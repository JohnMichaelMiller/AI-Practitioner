In this post I'll explore GitHub Copilot chat modes. I'll cover the built-in chat modes and custom chat modes. We'll dive into custom chat modes and look at some examples.

To be clear, when I reference Copilot, I'm referring to GitHub Copilot, not any other Microsoft Copilot-branded AI.

At first, Ask was the only Copilot chat mode. Ask mode only responds to prompts. Edit mode allowed the AI to change files. Agent mode allows Copilot to plan and execute work on it's own. In addition to these built-in chat modes, Copilot also supports custom chat modes which allow you to focus Copilot on specific tasks. You can have as many custom chat mode files as you like in a project. I'll discuss the cost of using custom chat modes later in the post.

## GitHub Copilot Chat Modes

These four GitHub Copilot modes in VS Code each serve distinct purposes, and knowing when to use which can dramatically streamline your coding and automation tasks:

### 🗣 Ask Mode–Quick Q&A and Conceptual Guidance

- Purpose: Conversational support for understanding code, tech concepts, or brainstorming.
- Behavior: Responds to natural language questions using context from your current file or selection.
- Use cases:
  - "Explain this PowerShell function."
  - "What's the best way to implement RBAC in Azure SQL?"
  - "Give me three ways to optimize this loop."
- Control: No code changes—just suggestions and explanations.
- Best for: Learning, debugging, and quick clarifications.

### ✍️ Edit Mode–Targeted Code Changes with Review Control

- Purpose: Apply inline edits across selected files based on your instructions.
- Behavior: You choose the files and describe the change; Copilot proposes edits you can accept or reject.
- Use cases:
  - "Refactor this to use async/await."
  - "Add error handling to this script."
  - "Write unit tests for this class."
- Control: Full review before applying changes.
- Best for: Surgical updates, refactoring, and enforcing coding standards.

### 🤖 Agent Mode–Autonomous Multi-Step Execution

- Purpose: Copilot acts as a coding agent, planning and executing complex tasks across your workspace.
- Behavior: Analyzes your codebase, runs terminal commands, edits files, and iterates until the task is complete.
- Use cases:
  - "Migrate this app from React to Vue."
  - "Audit all scripts for deprecated cmdlets."
  - "Build a PowerShell script to automate Azure SQL import with error handling."
- Control: Edits are applied automatically, but risky commands require approval.
- Best for: Large-scale automation, scaffolding, and multi-file refactoring.

### 🛠 ️Custom Chat Mode–Persona-Based AI Behavior

- Purpose: Define reusable modes with tailored instructions, tools, and model preferences.
- Behavior: You create `.chatmode.md` files that shape Copilot's tone, task focus, and tool access.
- Use cases:
  - "Security Scout" mode for vulnerability checks.
  - "Clean Code" mode for refactoring with style guides.
  - "PowerShell Admin" mode for scripting and automation.
- Control: You define the persona, tools, and scope.
- Best for: Consistency across teams, specialized workflows, and repeatable tasks.

Looking at the use cases, you can see that there is a progression of increasingly complex use cases. There is also a progression of cost that you should understand. More on that later. Try to align your uses of Copilot with the mode that is best for your case.

### 🔍 GitHub Copilot Summary Table

Here are the differences between the modes at a glance.

| Mode        | Scope            | Code Changes | Best For                             | Control Level      |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Ask         | Current file     | ❌ No        | Learning, Q&A, brainstorming         | Full user control  |
| Edit        | Selected files   | ✅ Proposed  | Refactoring, bug fixes, test writing | Review required    |
| Agent       | Entire workspace | ✅ Automatic | Automation, scaffolding, multi-step  | Semi-autonomous    |
| Custom Chat | User-defined     | ✅/❌ Varies | Specialized tasks, team consistency  | Fully customizable |

Do what you can to align your use of Copilot with the appropriate mode.

Let's take a deeper dive into custom chat modes.

## 🔧 What Is a Custom Chat Mode?

It's essentially a user-defined configuration file (`chatmode.md`) that tells Copilot how to think, act, and respond. For example, you can create modes tailored for:

- 🔄 Script refactoring with PowerShell best practices
- 🛡️ Compliance audits for RBAC in Azure SQL
- 📚 Clean documentation with markdown linting

Pretty much any repeated workflow or process is a good candidate for a custom chat mode.

Let's walk through the steps for creating a custom chat mode.

## 🪜 Step-by-Step: Creating Your Custom Chat Mode

1. Create a `chatmode.md` file.

- Open a new file in your repo or workspace and name it `chatmode.md`.

2. Define the mode's identity.

- Start with a name and focus area, for example:

```txt
# Mode Name: PowerShell Admin
## Focus: Automation, CLI consistency, error handling
```

The Mode Name will show up in the Set Mode drop-down in the VS Code Copilot Chat UI.

### 🎯 What the Chat Mode Focus Does

- Defines the mode's core purpose—e.g., automation, refactoring, auditing.
- Guides Copilot's response strategy—what to prioritize, what to avoid.
- Improves consistency—especially when switching between modes or sharing with teammates.

#### 🧠 How Copilot Uses Focus

When you load a mode with a Focus section, Copilot interprets it as a high-level directive. For example:

```txt
## Focus
- Automation, error handling, and CLI consistency
```

This tells Copilot to:

- Prefer modular PowerShell scripts
- Emphasize robust error handling
- Avoid speculative or overly creative suggestions

#### 🧩 Focus Best Practices

Here a some practices to keep in mind when setting focus.

| Tip                                 | Why It Helps                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Use short, clear phrases            | Keeps the mode readable and scannable |
| Align with tools and instructions   | Ensures coherence across the mode     |
| Avoid vague goals like "be helpful" | Specificity improves output quality   |

#### 🔍 Example Comparison

Here are some example foci and how the foci would affect Copilot's behavior.

| Mode Name        | Focus                      | Resulting Behavior                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| PowerShell Admin | Automation, error handling | Precise CLI scripts with retries and logging      |
| Clean Code       | Refactoring, readability   | Style-guide compliant suggestions                 |
| Security Scout   | Vulnerability checks       | Highlights insecure patterns and recommends fixes |

3. Specify instructions and behavior.

- Set tone, priorities, and response style:

```txt
- Be concise, use advanced scripting patterns
- Always propose modular solutions
- Prefer `$env:` for environment variables
```

4. List the tools Copilot can use.

- Map out relevant tools the mode should invoke:

```txt
tools:
  - PowerShell CLI
  - Azure SQL API
  - Markdown Linter
```

5. Set model preferences (optional).

- You can guide the underlying model with instructions like:

```txt
model:
  temperature: 0.4  # Less randomness, more precision
  style: structured
```

6. Save, load, and test.

- In VS Code, activate the mode by opening the chat interface and selecting your saved `chatmode.md`. Try commands like:

```txt
- "Build a CLI script for importing Azure SQL with retry logic."
- "Audit PowerShell scripts for deprecated cmdlets."
```

### 🎯 Pro Tip for Modular Workflow

Use multiple modes for different task scopes:

- One for RBAC auditing
- One for documentation linting
- One for script automation

You can switch between them or embed them in your MCP configs for seamless productivity.

## Managing Multiple Custom Chat Modes

Managing multiple custom chat mode files is a smart way to modularize your workflows. Here's how to keep things clean, scalable, and switchable:

🗂️ 1. Organize your chat mode files.

- Create a dedicated folder.
- Use `.github/chatmodes/` in your workspace to store all your `*.chatmode.md` files.
- Example structure:

```txt
.github/
  chatmodes/
    powershell-admin.chatmode.md
    security-scout.chatmode.md
    clean-code.chatmode.md
```

📦 2. Use clear naming conventions.

- Prefix by domain or task: `rbac-audit.chatmode.md`, `markdown-linter.chatmode.md`.
- Helps with discoverability and switching modes quickly.

## 🔄 Switching Between Modes in VS Code

- Open the Copilot Chat panel.
- Click the mode dropdown at the bottom.
- Select the desired mode from your saved list.
- Each mode loads its own tools, instructions, and model preferences.

## 🧠 Pro Tips for Managing Many Modes

Here are some tips on managing multiple custom chat mode files.

| Strategy                                 | Benefit                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Tag modes by team or task                | Easier collaboration and onboarding              |

This mode specializes in enhancing Playwright test scripts by enforcing high standards for security, test isolation, and CI/CD traceability. When reviewing automation, it flags potential vulnerabilities like injection risks or environment bleed, advocates for modular test architecture, and proposes scalable solutions to address brittle or insecure testing patterns—all with a clear emphasis on long-term maintainability.
This mode is asking for the most precision and is requesting the response be direct, risk-aware, and methodical.

## Chat Mode Cost Implications

It should come as no surprise that the more capable modes are more expensive. The cost implications depend on which mode you use and which model powers the response. Here's a breakdown based on GitHub Copilot's current pricing structure as of mid-2025:

### 💰 Cost Implications by Mode

Here are the cost implication by chat mode.

| Mode       | Cost Impact                                                                                                 | Notes                                                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ask Mode   | ✅ Free with included models (e.g., GPT‑4o, GPT‑4.1) <br> ❌ Premium if using GPT‑4.5, Claude, Gemini, etc. | Ask mode is cheapest if you stick to default models.         |
| Edit Mode  | ✅ Same as Ask Mode                                                                                         | Charges apply only if premium models are used.               |
| Agent Mode | ❌ Always counts as 1 premium request per prompt                                                            | Even with default models, Agent mode consumes premium quota. |

### 📦 Monthly Premium Request Allowance

Here are the monthly premium request allowances per plan.

| Plan           | Premium Requests | Cost          |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Copilot Free   | 50/month         | $0            |
| Copilot Pro    | 300/month        | $10/month     |
| Copilot Pro+   | 1500/month       | $39.99/month  |
| Extra Requests | $0.04/request    | Pay-as-you-go |

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Ask/edit modes are cost-efficient if you use included models.
- Agent mode always consumes premium requests—even for simple tasks.
- If you're running high-volume automation or multi-step refactoring, Agent mode can burn through your quota quickly.
- You can monitor usage in VS Code under Copilot › Settings › Billing & Usage.

## Conclusion

Effective use of chat modes is a key in both controlling Copilot and in managing costs. Custom chat modes allow you to change hats and tailor Copilot to work efficiently and effectively in different problem domains. Chat modes work in concert with instruction files, which is another way of controlling Copilot. I'll explore instruction files in another blog post soon.
