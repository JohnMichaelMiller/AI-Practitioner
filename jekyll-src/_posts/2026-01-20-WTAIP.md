This is the retro-inaugural post of the AI Practitioner's Blog. When I started the blog I jumped right into the content without a proper introduction. While I been in software development for many years, my only qualifications for writing a blog about AI is my experiences using the technology in anger creating real-world applications.

When I started the blog, my goal was to create a resource for professionals interested in the practical applications of artificial intelligence. By sharing my experences I hoped to provide insights and guidance to those looking to leverage AI in their own projects and organizations.

Feel free to share your thoughts and experiences on AI Assisted Software Development.
