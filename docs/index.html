While I been in software development for many years, my only qualifications for writing a blog about AI is my experiences using the technology in anger creating real-world applications.</p>

<p>When I started the blog, my goal was to create a resource for professionals interested in the practical applications of artificial intelligence. By sharing my experences I hoped to provide insights and guidance to those looking to leverage AI in their own projects and organizations.</p>

            Test Generation Using GitHub Copilot
          </a>
        </h3><p>Using AI in a production application is risky, particularly if you are new to working with NLM- generated code. This post will show how you can get started using AI in a production application by leveraging AI’s ability to generate test automation.</p>

<h2 id="a-good-place-to-start">A Good Place to Start</h2>

<p>If you’re hesitant to apply AI directly to a production codebase, that hesitation is well- grounded. We are at a point where NLMs are constantly reminding us of their fallibility. The consequences of introducing a serious defect into a fragile codebase is enough to put someone off.</p>

<h2 id="neglected-code">Neglected Code</h2>

<p>Test automation is one area of your code that is begging for a little help from AI. If the codebases that you work in are anything like the codebases I work in, test coverage is always lacking in one way or another, if it exists at all. Leveraging AI in test automation is a good way to add value without incurring significant risk.</p>

<h2 id="safe-because-test-automation-is-not-deployed-to-production">Safe Because Test Automation Is Not Deployed to Production</h2>

<p>The goal of good test automation is to prevent defects from reaching production and it is not intended to be deployed to production. Faulty test automation could return a false positive, failing when it shouldn’t, which is a broken test. That’s an inconvenience but it is not a major issue. The other possibility is a false negative, the test should have failed but didn’t. This is more serious, but is essentially the same as not having a test. Likely the state you’re in now.</p>

<p>An advantage test code has over application code is that in general, test code is simpler than application code. Typically unit test code exercises the interfaces of the code under test and examines the values returned by the code under test. Effective use of stubs and mocks excludes dependent code further simplifying the test. This makes NLM-generated test automation easier to review for completeness and correctness.</p>

<h2 id="test-automation-can-expose-design-and-architecture-issues">Test Automation Can Expose Design and Architecture Issues</h2>

<p>Asking an NLM to generate test automation for your code has the added advantage of providing an extra “pair of eyes” on your code. To an extent, the quality of the generated test code is correlated to the quality of the code being tested. Tests that are simple and straight forward are an indication that the code is testable. If the NLM has trouble generating tests or produces test that are complex or incomplete, it’s a sign that the code is not as testable as it could be and that some refactoring may be in order.</p>

<h2 id="enables-refactoring">Enables Refactoring</h2>

<p>Of course the major benefit from generating tests with an NLM is that, in the end, you have tests! And having tests is an enabler for refactoring and making improvements to the codebase.</p>

<h2 id="scoping-statement">Scoping Statement</h2>

<p>In addition to generating tests to increase code coverage, AI can increase the efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of a test suite. It can run tests faster and more precisely, reducing testing cycles. With predictive analytics, AI can prioritize tests likely to uncover defects, improving overall effectiveness. However to realize these benefits you need tests and this post is focused on unit test generation. We’ll get to these other benefits in due time as well generating other types of tests.</p>

<h2 id="further-scoping-statement">Further Scoping Statement</h2>

<p>There are many ways to generate tests. In this post I’ll focus on using GitHub Copilot to demonstrate the ins and outs of generating test automation and I’ll discuss Copilot’s strengths and weaknesses for this. The concepts are applicable to other NLMs but we won’t be comparing them here.</p>

<h2 id="why-copilot">Why Copilot</h2>

<p>GitHub Copilot is a reasonable choice for generating tests. It is supported in VS Code, Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Vim, and other IDEs. Integration into an IDE is advantageous as the IDE can expose the code to the NLM making it easy to tell the IDE to generate tests using the NLM for a function, method, class, etc.</p>

<h2 id="our-complex-code-that-needs-testing">Our Complex Code That Needs Testing</h2>

<p>To demonstrate generating automated tests we need code to test. More specifically, we need code that is not trivial and that has some degree of complexity to challenge the NLM’s test generation capabilities. Rather than trying to extract a snippet from an existing codebase or creating something from scratch, I handed the task off to Copilot.</p>

<p>My first attempt was with the prompt: “Can you create a C# class that has a high cyclomatic complexity?” which produced a complex class which would suffice but was based on numeric comparisons and not very readable. I added that “I’m looking for a real-world example” and Copilot produced a class similar to code below, which is much more suitable.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ProcessTransaction</code> method in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BankAccount</code> class handles two types of transactions: deposits and withdrawals. It first checks if the account is active. If not, it prints a message and exits. For each transaction type, it validates the amount and updates the balance accordingly, printing appropriate messages for each case. If the balance becomes negative, the account is deactivated.</p>

<p>This class is complex enough to require a good amount of test automation to provide adequate code coverage. Tests are needed for each transaction type and each transaction type has different conditions that need to be tested. Also the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IsActive</code> flag and the negative balance conditions need testing.</p>

<p>Copilot gave us complex code, not necessarily clean code and there are opportunities to improve this legacy code. But before we might attempt improvements we should have tests for the current implementation so that we can be confident that any refactoring doesn’t introduce defects.</p>

<h2 id="using-copilot-to-write-unit-tests">Using Copilot to Write Unit Tests</h2>

<p>Copilot has several ways to generate tests. I’m focusing on using the Copilot integration with Visual Studio Code which is fairly representative of other IDEs and techniques.</p>

<h3 id="generating-tests-in-vscode">Generating Tests in VSCode</h3>

<p>In VSCode there are two primary ways to generate tests. You can enter commands in Copilot chat or you can use the right-click menu in a code file and select to generate tests.</p>

<h4 id="generate-tests-for-the-makedepost-method">Generate Tests for the MakeDepost Method</h4>

<p>To generate tests for a single method or function in the Copilot chat, enter a prompt asking Copilot to generate tests for the method or function. For example, the prompt: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Generate unit tests for the MakeDeposit method of the BankAccount class</code> produced the code:</p>

<h4 id="explaining-the-tests">Explaining the Tests</h4>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MakeDeposit_ShouldCallProcessTransaction</code> test is designed to verify that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MakeDeposit</code> method of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BankAccount</code> class correctly calls the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ProcessTransaction</code> method with the appropriate parameters. It isolates the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ProcessTransaction</code> method by creating a mock of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BankAccount</code> class and then verifying that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ProcessTransaction</code> method of the mocked <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BankAccount</code> is called once with the expected parameter value.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MakeDeposit_ShouldIncreaseBalance</code> method is designed to verify that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MakeDeposit</code> method of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BankAccount</code> class correctly increases the account balance. It isolates the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ProcessTransaction</code> method by creating a mock of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BankAccount</code> class and implements a mock of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ProcessTransaction</code> method that assigns the expected value to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BankAccount.Balance</code> property using reflection.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MakeDeposit_ShouldNotChangeBalance_WhenAmountIsNegative</code> test is similar to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MakeDeposit_ShouldIncreaseBalance</code> test but does not change the balance. Since the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MakeDeposit</code> method has no code that behaves differently when the amount is negative it would be reasonable to drop this test.</p>

<p>Running these tests shows that two of these tests, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ProcessTransaction_ShouldNotProcessTransaction_OnInactiveAccount</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ProcessTransaction_ShouldDeactivateAccount_OnZeroBalance</code> are failing. These tests both depend on the state of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IsActive</code> flag. A closer look at the code shows that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IsActive</code> flag is set after the transactions types are handled when the balance is less than zero. The “Withdraw” transaction has a condition that prevents updating the balance if the amount is greater than the balance. The balance can never be zero and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IsActive</code> flag will never be cleared. Copilot found a bug!</p>

<h2 id="copilot-conundrums">Copilot Conundrums</h2>

<p>I’ve found that Copilot generated tests sometimes fail due to problems with the test implementation. The test will raise an unexpected error or an assertion will fail unexpectedly. I’ve found that using the error message or test output as a prompt in the same context will eventually resolve the problem. I ran across this when adding mocks to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MakeDeposit</code> method. At first the test failed trying to set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Balance</code> in the mock. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Balance</code> is private and can only be set within the class. Eventually Copilot arrived at a solution using reflection.</p>

<p>I’ve also found that when Copilot has trouble generating tests it can be an indication that the code is not easily testable. I’ve found instances where Copilot struggles to generate working mocks or that the mocking required to properly test the code is excessive. If you find that the complexity of the test code is equal to or exceeding the code under test, you may have no choice but to refactor the code before generating tests.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Leveraging GitHub Copilot for test automation offers numerous benefits, including increased test coverage, efficiency, and accuracy. By generating tests, Copilot can help identify design and architecture issues, enabling refactoring and other improvements to the codebase. Copilot, integrated with popular IDEs, provides a practical solution for generating unit tests, as demonstrated with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BankAccount</code> class example. While AI-generated tests may sometimes require adjustments, they ultimately contribute to a more robust and maintainable codebase. Embracing Copilot for test automation can significantly enhance the development process, making it more efficient and reliable.</p>

            Unleashing the Power of GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code
          </a>
        </h3><p>In recent years, AI has been revolutionizing the way we code. One of the most exciting developments in this field is GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code assistant developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI. It leverages machine learning models trained on billions of lines of public code, allowing it to understand context and provide relevant suggestions. Whether you’re writing a new function or fixing a bug, Copilot is there to help streamline your coding process. Let’s dive into the basics of using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to supercharge your development workflow.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<h3 id="1-installation">1. Installation</h3>

<p>To start using GitHub Copilot in VS Code, you’ll need to install the GitHub Copilot extension. Here’s how:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open Visual Studio Code.</li>

  <li>Search for “GitHub Copilot” and click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Install</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>GitHub Copilot is a paid service with a 30-day free trial. Refer to the GitHub documentation to select a plan and sign-up for an account. See <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/subscription-plans-for-github-copilot" target="_blank">Subscription plans for GitHub Copilot - GitHub Docs</a> for more information on signing up for Copilot.</p>

<h3 id="2-authentication">2. Authentication</h3>

<p>After installing the extension, you’ll need to authenticate with your GitHub account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open any file or create a new one.</li>
  <li>Start typing, and Copilot will prompt you to sign in to GitHub.</li>
  <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the sign-in process.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic Concepts</h2>

<h3 id="1-autocomplete-suggestions">1. Autocomplete Suggestions</h3>

<p>As you type, GitHub Copilot provides real-time code suggestions. You can accept these suggestions by pressing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tab</code>. If you see multiple suggestions, you can navigate through them using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Up</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Down</code> arrow keys.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2024-11-11/public-class-suggestion.png" alt="Copilot Auto-complete example" />
<br /></p>

<p>Here with little prompting of Copilot, other than the name of code file (circle.cs), Copilot generates suggested implementations of the class. The acceptance toolbar shows three suggestions and you can rotate through them with the arrows. From the toolbar you can also open the Completions Panel and see all suggestions. In this case, there are 10 suggestions. You can tab to accept the displayed suggestion or in the Completion Panel accept a specific suggestion.</p>

<p>Autocomplete makes a good attempt at suggesting code; when it’s context aware it becomes very powerful.</p>

<h3 id="2-context-aware-code">2. Context-Aware Code</h3>

<p>Copilot understands the context of your code. For example, if you’re writing a function, it can suggest complete function implementations based on the function name and its parameters. It can even provide comments and documentation snippets. The context-aware capabilities of GitHub Copilot allow it to understand the structure and purpose of your code.</p>

<p>Given this definition of the Circle class:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Circle</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Shape</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">Radius</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">get</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">set</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nf">Circle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">radius</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">Radius</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">radius</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">override</span> <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="nf">Area</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">Math</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">PI</span> <span class="p">*</span> <span class="n">Radius</span> <span class="p">*</span> <span class="n">Radius</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Copilot infers several things:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Class inheritance:</strong> The Circle class inherits from a Shape class, suggesting that Circle is a specific type of shape.</li>
  <li><strong>Properties and methods:</strong> The class has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Radius</code> property and an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Area</code> method, indicating that it deals with geometric calculations.</li>
  <li><strong>Constructor:</strong> The constructor initializes the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Radius</code> property, which is essential for any calculations involving the circle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given this context, when you ask Copilot to add a new method, it suggests relevant methods that are typical for a circle, such as calculating the circumference. It can also provide appropriate comments and documentation based on common practices:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    <span class="c1">/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
    <span class="c1">/// Calculates the circumference of the circle.</span>
    <span class="c1">/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span class="c1">/// &lt;returns&gt;The circumference of the circle.&lt;/returns&gt;</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="nf">Circumference</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="m">2</span> <span class="p">*</span> <span class="n">Math</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">PI</span> <span class="p">*</span> <span class="n">Radius</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>For example, when adding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Circumference</code> method, Copilot understands that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The method should be related to the geometric properties of a circle.</li>
  <li>It should use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Radius</code> property.</li>
  <li>It should follow the same style and conventions as the existing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Area</code> method.</li>
  <li>This context awareness helps Copilot provide accurate and relevant code suggestions that fit seamlessly into your existing codebase.</li>
</ul>

<p>Context awareness learns how you write code and tries to emulate your style. For example, if you start and end most methods with a log entry, Copilot will recognize the pattern and offer to insert a log entry consistent with the pattern and tailored to the current context.</p>

<h3 id="3-multi-line-completions">3. Multi-line Completions</h3>

<p>For more complex tasks, Copilot can suggest multi-line completions. These are especially useful for boilerplate code, loops, or error handling. You can accept these suggestions in the same way as single-line completions. The auto-complete suggestions for the circle class example is a good example of multi-line insertions.</p>

<h3 id="4-example-based-learning">4. Example-Based Learning</h3>

<p>You can teach Copilot by providing examples. If you write a few lines of code or a comment describing what you want, Copilot can suggest the next lines of code. This can be incredibly powerful for repetitive tasks or following specific coding patterns.</p>

<p>For example, if we add the comment to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">circle.cs</code>:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Oval is a shape class that inherits from Circle and overrides the Area method</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>And we start the definition of a class on the next line. Copilot will suggest a class that implements the comment.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2024-11-11/Oval-class.png" alt="Copilot Oval class suggestion" /></p>

<p>This works for other code comments. The comment, “Loop through all of the accounts and apply a discounts of 10% to the accounts with a lifetime value greater than 100000” would generate a suggestion that contained a request for the accounts, a loop through the accounts, a condition to select an account, and that application of the discount. If Copilot is aware how data is requested in other parts of the app, how lifetime value is derived, and how discounts are applied.</p>

<h2 id="copilot-workspaces">Copilot Workspaces</h2>

<p>The @workspace command in GitHub Copilot is a powerful feature that allows you to ask questions about your entire codebase. When you use @workspace, Copilot intelligently retrieves relevant files and symbols from your workspace to provide context-aware answers. Here are some ways you can use @workspace:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Finding Existing Code:</strong> You can ask questions like, “Where is the database connection string configured?” or “How can I validate a date?” Copilot will find and reference the relevant code in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">workspace1</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Planning Code Edits:</strong> You can ask for plans on how to implement specific features, such as, “How can I add a rich tool-tip to a button?” or “Add date validation to #selection”. Copilot will provide a plan based on your existing code.</li>
  <li><strong>Explaining Concepts:</strong> You can ask higher-level questions like, “How is authentication implemented?” or “Which API routes depend on this service?” Copilot will give an overview and reference relevant parts of your code.</li>
  <li><strong>Workspace Context:</strong> @workspace uses the same sources a developer would when navigating a codebase in VS Code, such as all files in the workspace (except those ignored by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code>), directory structure, symbols, and definitions.</li>
</ul>

<p>By using @workspace, you can make Copilot an expert in your workspace, helping you navigate and understand your codebase more effectively.</p>

<h2 id="copilot-functions">Copilot Functions</h2>

        <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">then</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">response</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">response</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">json</span><span class="p">())</span>
        <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">then</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">);</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="p">})</span>
        <span class="p">.</span><span class="k">catch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">error</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">Error fetching data:</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">error</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>You can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/doc</code> command to add comments:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/doc fetchData method in DataService.js</code></p>

<p>Copilot will then add appropriate documentation comments to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetchData</code> method.</p>

<p>These commands can help you quickly perform tasks and get information without leaving your IDE, making your coding process more efficient.</p>

<h3 id="chat-window-chat-with-extension-feature">Chat Window, Chat With Extension Feature</h3>

            Boosting Developer Productivity with AI Tools and Effective Strategies
          </a>
        </h3><p>The phrase “developers will not be replaced by AI, they’ll be replaced by developers that use AI” underscores a critical shift in the tech industry. It highlights that AI is not a threat to developers’ jobs but rather a powerful tool that can enhance their capabilities. Developers who embrace AI can automate repetitive tasks, gain deeper insights through data analysis, and accelerate their coding processes. This allows them to focus on more complex, creative, and strategic aspects of their work. In contrast, those who resist adopting AI may find themselves at a disadvantage, as they miss out on the efficiency and innovation that AI can bring. Essentially, the future belongs to developers who leverage AI to augment their skills and productivity, staying ahead in an increasingly competitive landscape.</p>

<p>In today’s fast-paced tech environment, enhancing developer productivity is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge. Recent studies and reports have highlighted several ways to achieve this, particularly through the use of AI tools and strategic work practices. Let’s dive into some key findings and how they can be applied to your development teams.</p>

<p>AI is different from other changes in software development in that AI changes how developers work. Prior to AI as new languages get released and new coding practices are adopted, developers needed to manually implement the changes. AI can help with the actual implementation and becomes a partner in the software development process. Whether they completely understand it or not, hiring managers will want developers who are proficient in AI because developers who can leverage AI are significantly more effective.</p>

<p>Enhancing developer productivity is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge. Recent studies and reports have highlighted several ways to achieve this, particularly through the use of AI tools and strategic work practices. Let’s dive into some key findings and how they can be applied to your development teams.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-generative-ai-tools">The Power of Generative AI Tools</h2>

<p>Generative AI tools are revolutionizing the way developers work. According to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/unleashing-developer-productivity-with-generative-ai?cid=eml-web" target="_blank">McKinsey</a>, these tools can significantly speed up common tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Documenting Code: Tasks that typically take hours can be completed in half the time.</li>
  <li>Writing New Code: Developers can write new code nearly twice as fast.</li>
  <li>Optimizing Existing Code: Code optimization can be done in nearly two-thirds the time it usually takes.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to McKinsey, in my own experience I would add test automation, pipeline implementation and debugging to the tasks that can benefit from AI assistance.</p>

<p>These tools not only enhance speed but also help maintain high code quality, allowing developers to focus on more complex and creative aspects of their work.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-developer-community/putting-tools-in-your-hands-to-improve-developer-productivity/ba-p/2902225" target="_blank">A study by Microsoft</a> emphasizes the value of deep work for developers. Developers who have dedicated time for uninterrupted work report feeling 50% more productive. I’ve found that AI allows me to stay focused by keeping me from having to interrupt others. I also avoid the time-consuming hunt for relevant information. AI either fixes the issue or explains the current implementation and makes suggestions.</p>

<p>Of course, AI doesn’t always pan out and you have go old school, but every time it does work, it keeps you in the flow and that makes you more efficient.</p>

<h2 id="enhancing-the-developer-experience">Enhancing the Developer Experience</h2>

<p>Improving the overall developer experience has a direct impact on productivity. McKinsey found that a better developer experience can lead to a 20-30% reduction in customer-reported product defects and a 20% improvement in employee experience scores. This underscores the importance of providing developers with the right tools and a positive work environment.</p>

<p>AI gives you superpowers. Your fear and anxiety drops; you have more confidence taking on unfamiliar work. Your quality goes up because you are able to automate more tests and safety checks. You worry less about about syntax and do more implementation. Isn’t this the developer experience we all want?</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the high pressure world of software development, I need to leverage every advantage I can and AI has proven to be quite an advantage. AI is the first major change in how developers work since paper tape and punch cards. To use a term by Doug Finke, you need to adopt an AI mindset.</p>

<p>This blog is dedicated to exploring how AI can make software development more efficient and make developers more effective. We’ll explore concrete examples, new tooling, improvements in the models and how to apply AI to full life cycle of a software development project. Watch this space!</p>
