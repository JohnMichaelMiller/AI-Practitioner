            Welcome to the AI Practitioner&#39;s Blog
          </a>
        </h3><p>This is the retro-inaugural post of the AI Practitioner’s Blog. When I started the blog I jumped right into the content without a proper introduction. While I been in software development for many years, my only qualifications for writing a blog about AI is my experiences using the technology in anger creating real-world applications.</p>

            What&#39;s the Big Deal?
          </a>
        </h3><p>I’ve been reading posts describing AI-assisted software development as revolutionary. As if something fundamental has changed. While this take is understandable, in my view, it misses the mark. In my opinion programming hasn’t changed, but how we go about it has changed, again. In this post I’ll compare programming’s past, present and future and talk about what has changed and what hasn’t. Let’s first look at the past.</p>

            Sharing Instructions with the Team
          </a>
        </h3><p>When working with GitHub Copilot across multiple projects, you’ll quickly face a common challenge: how do you share generic instructions (ie. coding standards and best practices) with team members working on different projects without duplicating instruction files in every repository? This post walks you through prompting Copilot to implement a solution leveraging symlinks and junction points.</p>

        </h3><p>This post starts a new series on greenfield software development. The goal is to show the development of a solution starting with the initial context and adding to the solution incrementally. Hopefully you’ll get a sense for what it’s like to build real-world solutions with the assistance of Copilot.</p>

            Unleashing the Power of GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code
          </a>
        </h3><p>In recent years, AI has been revolutionizing the way we code. One of the most exciting developments in this field is GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code assistant developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI. It leverages machine learning models trained on billions of lines of public code, allowing it to understand context and provide relevant suggestions. Whether you’re writing a new function or fixing a bug, Copilot is there to help streamline your coding process. Let’s dive into the basics of using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to supercharge your development workflow.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/BDPwAI/">
            Boosting Developer Productivity with AI Tools and Effective Strategies
          </a>
        </h3><p>The phrase “developers will not be replaced by AI, they’ll be replaced by developers that use AI” underscores a critical shift in the tech industry. It highlights that AI is not a threat to developers’ jobs but rather a powerful tool that can enhance their capabilities. Developers who embrace AI can automate repetitive tasks, gain deeper insights through data analysis, and accelerate their coding processes. This allows them to focus on more complex, creative, and strategic aspects of their work. In contrast, those who resist adopting AI may find themselves at a disadvantage, as they miss out on the efficiency and innovation that AI can bring. Essentially, the future belongs to developers who leverage AI to augment their skills and productivity, staying ahead in an increasingly competitive landscape.</p>
