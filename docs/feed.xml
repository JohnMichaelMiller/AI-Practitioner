<p>This is the fourth post in the series on AI‑assisted greenfield software development. If you’re joining mid‑stream, you may want to begin with <a href="https://blog.pdata.com/AIAGSD1/">Part 1: Business Requirements</a>, where we established the foundation for an AI‑driven development workflow. Parts 2 and 3 expanded that foundation with scaffolding, project‑level instructions, and Git workflow guidance.</p>

<p>In this post, we shift from <em>project‑level</em> instructions to <em>architecture‑level</em> instructions. This is where we define the structural rules that guide AI agents as they generate code—ensuring consistency, correctness, and architectural integrity across the entire solution.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-architecture-instruction-files-matter">Why Architecture Instruction Files Matter</h2>

<p>When humans build software, architecture is often implicit—shared understanding, tribal knowledge, and experience fill in the gaps. AI doesn’t have that luxury. Without explicit architectural rules, AI agents tend to optimize for convenience rather than coherence.</p>

<p>Architecture instruction files solve this by providing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A clear architectural pattern</li>
  <li>Implementation rules and constraints</li>
  <li>Folder and feature structure</li>
  <li>Cross‑cutting concerns</li>
  <li>Anti‑patterns to avoid</li>
  <li>Testing expectations</li>
  <li>Success criteria for generated code</li>
</ul>

<p>These files become the “rails” that keep AI‑generated code aligned with the intended system design.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.pdata.com/AIAGSD4/">Part 4</a>, we focus on one of the most widely used architectural patterns in modern backend systems: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CQRS</code>. I’ve chosen <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CQRS</code> because it is not a trivial architecture and is a good test of AI’s ability to create architectural instructions and implement in accordance with those instructions.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-is-cqrs">What Is CQRS?</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CQRS</code> (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) architectural pattern separates read operations (queries) from write operations (commands). Instead of a single model handling everything, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CQRS</code> splits responsibilities so each side can be optimized independently.</p>

<h3 id="core-principle">Core Principle</h3>

<p>Traditional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CRUD</code> applications use a single model to handle both read and write operations. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CQRS</code> separates these concerns by introducing two distinct models: one dedicated to commands (writes) and another focused on queries (reads).</p>

<p><strong>Commands</strong></p>

<p>A command is responsible for modifying the system’s state and carrying out the necessary business logic to make that change meaningful. Its job ends there—it does not return any domain‑level data, only an acknowledgment that the operation completed. Command examples are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CreateOrderCommand</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ChangePasswordCommand</code></p>

<p><strong>Queries</strong></p>

<p>A query’s sole responsibility is to retrieve information from the system. It provides data back to the caller but never alters application state or triggers any side effects</p>

<h3 id="key-benefits">Key Benefits</h3>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CQRS</code> makes it possible to scale the read and write sides of the system independently, allowing each to grow according to its own demands. Because the two responsibilities are separated, each side can use models tailored to its specific purpose, with the read side often taking advantage of denormalized structures to maximize performance. This separation also creates cleaner security boundaries, making it easier to control who can read or modify data. And since the two sides operate independently, each can use the storage technology best suited to its workload, giving the architecture far more flexibility overall</p>

<h3 id="common-implementation-pattern">Common Implementation Pattern</h3>

<p>Write operations trigger events that update read models. This creates an <em>eventually consistent</em> system—an intentional tradeoff that unlocks performance and scalability.</p>

<h3 id="when-cqrs-is-a-good-fit">When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CQRS</code> Is a Good Fit</h3>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CQRS</code> is especially effective in environments where read operations vastly outnumber writes, allowing the system to optimize each side independently. It also shines in domains with intricate business rules, where separating commands and queries helps keep complexity manageable. Architectures built around event sourcing benefit naturally from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CQRS</code>, as do multi‑tenant applications that must serve diverse read patterns. And in systems where auditability is essential, the clear separation of responsibilities makes tracking and verifying changes far more straightforward.</p>

<h3 id="when-to-avoid-it">When to Avoid It</h3>

<p>If your application is simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CRUD</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CQRS</code> adds complexity without meaningful benefit.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="creating-the-architecture-prompt-file">Creating the Architecture Prompt File</h2>

<p>Prior to creating CQRS instructions, I created a prompt file to guide the creation of the instructions. By asking Copilot to create a prompt file, you give Copilot a chance to add relevant context to the which improves the prompt, which in turn will improve the instructions generated by the prompt.</p>

<p>When generating GitHub AI guidance I used the custom <a href="https://github.com/johnmillerATcodemag-com/zeus.academia.3b/blob/a0ce78c1e527432044f574dafe4cca7cdacdd099/.github/chatmodes/prompt-engineer.chatmode.md">prompt-engineer.chatmode.md</a> chat mode, introduced in <a href="https://blog.pdata.com/AIAGSD2/">Part 2</a>, which focuses Copilot on the skills needed to generate effective prompts.</p>

<p>When working with GitHub AI guidance there is always a chicken-and-egg problem. For Copilot to generate an artifact, you need a prompt. In this case we want Copilot to generate a prompt file. We could create a prompt file that would generate the prompt file we need to generate the instruction file. This is a recursive process with diminishing returns. At some point we’d need to manually prompt Copilot to bootstrap the artifact generation.</p>

<p>Here is the manual prompt I used to generate the prompt file: <em>Create a prompt file that generates instruction files for a CQRS architecture. The prompt file should target AI agents and be optimized to reduce token consumption.</em></p>

<p>By asking Copilot to generate a prompt file, Copilot will use the <a href="https://github.com/johnmillerATcodemag-com/zeus.academia.3b/blob/a0ce78c1e527432044f574dafe4cca7cdacdd099/.github/instructions/ai-assisted-output.instructions.md">ai-assisted-output.instructions.md</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/johnmillerATcodemag-com/zeus.academia.3b/blob/a0ce78c1e527432044f574dafe4cca7cdacdd099/.github/instructions/prompt-file-generation.instructions.md">prompt-file-generation.instructions.md</a> to guide the generation of the prompt file. This ensures the prompt file conforms to the AI output instructions and the instructions for generating prompts.</p>

<p>All of this meta guidance (prompts that generate prompts which create instructions that govern the generation of code) can get confusing. Take a close look at the files I’ve referenced in this post and have Copilot explain anything you don’t quite understand.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="understanding-the-generate-cqrs-eventsourcing-instructionspromptmd-prompt-file">Understanding the <a href="https://github.com/johnmillerATcodemag-com/zeus.academia.3b/blob/13fc7e8eb6fa47a5f933cd0e427dc7c65642f5c0/.github/prompts/generate-cqrs-eventsourcing-instructions.prompt.md">generate-cqrs-eventsourcing-instructions.prompt.md</a> prompt file.</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/johnmillerATcodemag-com/zeus.academia.3b/blob/13fc7e8eb6fa47a5f933cd0e427dc7c65642f5c0/.github/prompts/generate-cqrs-eventsourcing-instructions.prompt.md">generate-cqrs-eventsourcing-instructions.prompt.md</a> prompt file instructs an AI agent to generate a complete instruction file for implementing CQRS with Event Sourcing patterns in a specific programming language and technology stack. The agent takes four parameters, the programming language, mediator framework, event store implementation, and projection strategy, and produces a comprehensive .instructions.md file that will guide future AI-assisted code generation.</p>

<p>The instruction file content follows a rigid 15-section structure. The agent begins with a brief overview, then creates a reference table defining core concepts like events, aggregates, event stores, projections, and snapshots. It documents three main implementation patterns, command handling with event-sourced aggregates, event store operations for writing and reading event streams, and query handling using projections rather than direct event store access.</p>

<p>For each pattern, the agent provides structure tables showing components, their purposes, and file locations, followed by implementation rules written as imperative directives. It includes minimal code templates demonstrating aggregate event application, command handlers that append events with optimistic concurrency, and projection subscribers that update read models. The agent specifies snapshot strategies for performance optimization when aggregates accumulate many events, and documents the chosen projection approach (inline, background worker, or separate service).</p>

<p>Additional sections cover event schema design with versioning strategies, aggregate reconstruction patterns, idempotency handling, anti-patterns to avoid, event schema evolution techniques using upcasters, and testing approaches. The agent concludes with a validation checklist ensuring all critical patterns are documented.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="creating-the-architecture-instruction-file">Creating the Architecture Instruction File</h2>

<p>With the prompt file in place, I generated a concrete instruction file. Using the prompt:</p>

<p><em>Submit the prompt generate-cqrs-eventsourcing-instructions.prompt.md in the C# language, the MediatR framework, the EventStoreDB event_store and inline projections</em></p>

<p>This generates an instruction that directs AI agents to generate C# code that strictly separates command handling from query handling, using MediatR for mediation and EventStoreDB for persistence. When creating commands, agents must structure them so handlers validate inputs, load aggregates by replaying events, execute domain logic that returns new events without mutating state, and append those events using optimistic concurrency checks. Agents are instructed to never allow aggregates to directly modify their internal state; instead, all state changes must flow through Apply() methods that process events.</p>

<p>For queries, agents must create handlers that read exclusively from denormalized read models stored in a separate database schema, never directly accessing the event store. The file mandates inline projections that update read models synchronously within the same transaction as event appends, ensuring immediate consistency. Agents must implement projection classes with event handler methods that transform events into read model updates.</p>

<p>When building aggregates, agents are directed to implement Apply() methods for rebuilding state from event streams and command methods that validate business rules then yield new events. The file prohibits direct property setters and requires immutable event types, preferably using C# records. Agents must name event streams following the “{aggregate}-{id}” pattern and include full metadata with each event.</p>

<p>For performance optimization, agents are instructed to implement snapshot stores that cache aggregate state when streams exceed 50-100 events, loading aggregates from the latest snapshot plus subsequent events rather than replaying entire streams. The file directs agents to handle event versioning through upcaster classes that transform old event formats during reads.</p>

<p>Agents must implement idempotency through MediatR pipeline behaviors that track command identifiers and prevent duplicate processing. Testing code should follow Given-When-Then patterns, verifying events produced by commands, read model updates from projections, and state transitions in aggregates.</p>

<p>The instruction file explicitly prohibits several patterns: querying event stores for reads, mutating aggregate state outside event application, deleting events, sharing events between aggregates, and loading multiple aggregates in command handlers. It enforces a strict project structure segregating commands, queries, projections, aggregates, events, and infrastructure concerns into designated directories.</p>

<p>Throughout, agents are directed to use MediatR’s IRequestHandler interface for all command and query handlers, EventStoreDB’s AppendAsync with ExpectedVersion for writes, and dedicated read database contexts for queries. The file provides code templates showing exactly how to structure each component, ensuring agents generate consistent, pattern-compliant implementations.</p>

<p>At this point, the AI has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Business requirements</li>
  <li>Project‑level instructions</li>
  <li>Architecture‑level instructions</li>
</ul>

<p>To complete the foundation we need technology specific instructions and project implementation guidance.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="checking-the-context">Checking the Context</h2>

<p>Before moving on, it’s a good idea to review the .github governance (prompts, instructions, etc.) as whole to make sure there aren’t conflicting governance that could confuse Copilot. In <a href="https://blog.pdata.com/AIAGSD2/">Part 2</a> I introduced the check-context.prompt.md file that examines the current context and reports any anomalies that should be addressed.</p>

<p>Here is the Quality Assessment portion of the analysis:</p>

<p>✅ Complete AI provenance metadata (all required fields)
✅ Copilot prompt metadata (description, context, expected_output)
✅ Optional fields included (tools, mode) for enhanced functionality
✅ Token-optimized content (~200 tokens core content)
✅ Clear structured output format (YAML for parseability)
✅ Actionable 6-step validation workflow
✅ Comprehensive 7-category conflict detection
✅ Conversation and summary logs complete</p>

<p>This is a prompt that should be submitted any time the .github governance changes. Copilot didn’t find any issues to address, so we are good to proceed.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>In Part 5, I’ll add instruction files for the technologies we’re implementing. These instructions will guide Copilot in the details for implementing specific technologies. We’ll cover naming conventions, patterns, namespaces, standards, and templates for implementing the classes that will be implemented.</p>

<p>If you’d like to explore the files or follow along with your own implementation, everything is available in the Academia GitHub repository. Fork it, experiment, and adapt it to your own workflow.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2025-12-30/header-AIAGSD3.png" alt="Header Image" /> We’ll use these prompt’s to create instruction files and then check the guidance for errors and redundancies.</p>

<p>To achieve quality in AI code generation you need to constrain the AI model and focus it on what you intend to accomplish. Unconstrained, AI has many options to choose from and the chances that the AI will choose the wrong option are the greatest. This is where models are most non-deterministic and subject to hallucinations and errors.</p>

<p>By specifying custom chat-modes, prompts and instructions, you set the expectations for the intended output and how it’s produced. As long as the instructions are clear and unambiguous, the model will respect the constraints. This isn’t about slowing down; it’s about moving fast <em>safely.</em></p>

<h2 id="provenance-is-king-ai-assisted-outputinstructionsmd">Provenance Is King (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ai-assisted-output.instructions.md</code>)</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.codemag.com/blog/AIPractitioner/AIAGSD2">In Part 2</a> we added our <strong>AI Provenance Policy.</strong> We can no longer accept code if we don’t know where it came from. We’ve defined a metadata schema that <em>must</em> accompany every AI-generated artifact. Whether it’s a Python script, a documentation file, or a diagram, it needs a “birth certificate.” We also want to record the conversation with AI that led to the generation of an artifact and a summery of the context used in producing the artifact. The AI assisted output instructions ensure that this provenance is recorded for standards compliance and as breadcrumbs for our AI generation effort. We’ll see this in all generated artifacts from here on.</p>

<h2 id="the-development-life-cycle-ai-dev-processinstructionsmd">The Development Life Cycle (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ai-dev-process.instructions.md</code>)</h2>

<p>In addition to the AI output instructions, we’re adding instructions that formalizes the dance between <strong>human</strong> and <strong>machine.</strong> It’s no longer just “generate and commit.” This file introduces a specific workflow:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>AI Code Generation:</strong> Must include provenance and pass existing tests.</li>
  <li><strong>AI Code Review::</strong> The AI reviews its own work (or another agent’s work) for security, performance, and style <em>before</em> a human sees it.</li>
  <li><strong>Human Code Review:</strong> We focus on high-level architecture and intent, letting the AI handle the linting and boilerplate checks.</li>
</ol>

<p>We also define <strong>Quality Gates.</strong> You can’t merge unless you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Technical Gates (CI/CD passing)</li>
  <li>AI Review (Automated pass)</li>
  <li>Human Approval (Final sign-off)</li>
</ul>

<p>This process can be enhanced to increase the ability of AI to produce quality code. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a different model to review the code than the model that generated it.</li>
  <li>Use three models to review the code and only pass the review if two of the three models agree on the quality of the code.</li>
  <li>Use multiple models to generate code and have AI review the pros and cons of each implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Models have biases, if only to their own work. By utilizing multiple models you mitigate for these biases and the different perspectives can add to the robustness of the implementations.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the
<a href="https://github.com/johnmillerATcodemag-com/zeus.academia.3b/blob/Part-Three/.github/instructions/ai-dev-process.instructions.md" target="_blank"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ai-dev-process.instructions.md</code></a> file.</p>

<p>The AI-assisted software development process further constrains what the AI can do when working with code in the project. It’s important to note that these constraints only apply when AI is actively working. If you want these constrains to apply to human developers on your team, you’ll want to add gates to the repository to enforce the constraints across the board.</p>

<h2 id="git-workflow-integration-git-workflowinstructionsmd">Git Workflow Integration (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git-workflow.instructions.md</code>)</h2>

<p>Another process we should nail down is how AI generated code is incorporated into the life cycle. While AI generated code should follow the same process as developer written code, there are some differences we might want to require.</p>

<p>In the Git Workflow instructions file, we’ve required a <strong>trunk-based Development (TBD)</strong> model. TBD is the practice of merging small, frequent updates to a single core branch (often called main or trunk), rather than maintaining long-lived feature branches. By requiring developers and AI agents to merge code at least daily, we minimize the “drift” that leads to catastrophic merge conflicts. It forces a discipline of continuous integration, ensuring the codebase is always in a deployable state. It relies heavily on automated testing to prevent breaking the build for everyone.</p>

<p>While we’ve chosen TBD for speed, <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-flow" target="_blank">Git Flow</a> remains a popular alternative, utilizing a strict structure of develop, release, and feature branches that is excellent for managed release cycles but often cumbersome for rapid iteration. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow" target="_blank">GitHub Flow</a> is another common contender, simplifying Git Flow by deploying directly from feature branches, but for our high-velocity AI workflow, the immediate integration of TBD is essential. If you prefer Git Flow or GitHub flow you can modify the prompt that generated the instruction file (the prompts are covered later in this post) and create a Git Flow or GitHub specific instruction file.</p>

<p>Here are the AI specific features of the workflow:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AI branches:</strong> We use a specific naming convention <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ai/&lt;chat-id&gt;-&lt;description&gt;</code>. This makes it instantly obvious which branches are machine-generated.</li>
  <li><strong>Commit messages:</strong> Must reference the Chat ID and Model.</li>
  <li><strong>Orphan cleanup:</strong> AI branches are ephemeral. If they aren’t merged in 7 days, they are deleted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a link to the <a href="https://github.com/johnmillerATcodemag-com/zeus.academia.3b/blob/Part-Three/.github/instructions/git-workflow.instructions.md" target="_blank"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git-workflow.instructions.md</code></a> file.</p>

<p>Like the AI development instructions, some of the requirement enforcement should be implemented through repo or pipeline configuration. This is called out in the <strong>Enforcement</strong> section of the instruction file.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-picture-project-overviewinstructionsmd">The Big Picture (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project-overview.instructions.md</code>)</h2>

<p>Finally, we created the project overview instructions to tie everything together. It acts as the entry point for any new agent (or human) joining the project, pointing them to the standards and critical files they need to respect.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the <a href="https://github.com/johnmillerATcodemag-com/zeus.academia.3b/blob/Part-Three/.github/instructions/project-overview.instructions.md" target="_blank"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project-overview.instructions.md</code></a> file.</p>

<p>The project overview instructions are a snapshot of the project in time. As the project evolves we’ll update the project overview so that it always contains the current state of the project.</p>

<h2 id="checking-the-context">Checking the Context</h2>

<p>When adding or changing instruction files it’s important to verify that all of the instructions are complimentary. The <a href="https://github.com/johnmillerATcodemag-com/zeus.academia.3b/blob/Part-Three/.github/prompts/check-context.prompt.md" target="_blank">check-context.prompt.md</a> prompt file examines the current context for conflicting instructions, factual inconsistencies, logical contradictions, priority conflicts, technical incompatibilities, terminology gaps, and redundancies.</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to submit this prompt to a different model than was used to generate the instruction files to avoid the model favoring it’s own output.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>By codifying these rules into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.instructions.md</code> files, we are doing something powerful: <strong>We are programming the process.</strong></p>

<p>When we load these instructions into our AI context, the AI <em>knows</em> how to behave. It knows it needs to generate metadata. It knows it needs to create a log entry. It becomes a compliant member of the team, rather than a chaotic tool.</p>

<h2 id="the-prompt-files">The Prompt Files</h2>

<p>Looking at the metadata for each of these artifacts you can see that a prompt file was used to create each instruction file. The prompt files, in concert with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">instruction-file-generation.instructions.md</code> instructions, define the contents of the generated instruction files.</p>

<p>While the instructions could have been created directly, the benefit of using a prompt file is that it codifies the structure and contents of the generated instruction files. If the process or tooling changes, the prompt can be modified and the instruction files updated.</p>

<p>This helps to maintain the instruction files. For example, if the Git process changes from trunk-based to Git Flow or GitHub Flow, the prompt can be updated and the instructions regenerated.</p>

<p>More importantly, the process of creating the instruction files is documented and committed to the repo.</p>

<p>How were the prompt files created? With AI assistance, of course. Using a simple prompt like:</p>

<p><em>Create a prompt file to create an Project Overview instruction file containing the high level context for the project. The instruction file should be optimized for AI agents and to minimize the token requirements.</em></p>

<p>When submitted, AI will create a prompt file that conforms to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prompt-file-generation.instructions.md</code> instructions and meets the intent of creating the project overview instructions.</p>

<p>Here are links to the prompt files that created the instruction files: <a href="https://github.com/johnmillerATcodemag-com/zeus.academia.3b/blob/Part-Three/.github/prompts/create-ai-dev-process.prompt.md" target="_blank"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create-ai-dev-process.prompt.md</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/johnmillerATcodemag-com/zeus.academia.3b/blob/Part-Three/.github/prompts/create-git-workflow-instructions.prompt.md" target="_blank"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create-git-workflow-instructions.prompt.md</code></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/johnmillerATcodemag-com/zeus.academia.3b/blob/Part-Three/.github/prompts/create-project-overview.prompt.md" target="_blank"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create-project-overview.prompt.md</code></a></p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>This concludes the work of establishing the core instructions we need and moves us closer to starting an implementation. In Part 4 we’ll add instructions that define the architecture and the architecture implementation. Establishing a path that the AI can follow when implementing the solution.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in seeing the files, you can find them in the <a href="https://github.com/johnmillerATcodemag-com/zeus.academia.3b" target="_blank">Academia GitHub repository</a>.

<!--more-->

<p><img src="/assets/images/2025-12-01/header-WTBD.png" alt="Header Image" /></p>

<p>I’ve been reading posts describing AI-assisted software development as revolutionary. As if something fundamental has changed. While this take is understandable, in my view, it misses the mark. In my opinion programming hasn’t changed, but how we go about it has changed, again. In this post I’ll compare programming’s past, present and future and talk about what has changed and what hasn’t. Let’s first look at the past.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-programming-innovations-the-past">A Brief History of Programming Innovations (The Past)</h2>

<p>Ever since the first computer was booted, there has been a need for coders to instruct the computer to get it to do something useful. This need has not changed and likely, will never change. What has changed is how coders instruct the computer. Over the decades, programming has evolved through several major innovations, each enabled by new technologies that transformed how humans express intent to machines. Below is a brief overview of when these innovations and their enabling technologies became mainstream.</p>

<h3 id="machine-code--assembly-1940s1940s">Machine Code &amp; Assembly (1940s–1940s)</h3>

<p>Machine code was the raw binary language of early computers, executed directly by hardware built on vacuum tubes and electro-mechanical relays. Programs were entered through physical means: flipping panel switches, plugging cables, feeding punched cards into IBM readers, or threading perforated paper tape into tape readers. These input devices were the enabling technologies that allowed binary instructions to be stored and executed. Programming was a mechanical ritual defined by the hum of machinery, the clatter of card punches, and the whir of tape readers.</p>

<p>Assembly language introduced symbolic mnemonics like MOV, ADD, and JMP to replace raw binary. Assemblers—software tools that translated these mnemonics into machine code—were the enabling technology that made this possible. While programmers still thought in terms of registers and memory addresses, assembly reduced the burden of direct binary coding. It remains mainstream today in embedded systems, operating system kernels, and performance-critical applications.</p>

<h3 id="high-level-languages-1950s-1970s">High-Level Languages (1950s-1970s)</h3>

<p>High-level languages abstracted away hardware details, allowing humans to write code in math-like or business-oriented syntax. This leap was enabled by compilers and interpreters, which translated human-readable instructions into machine code. FORTRAN (1957) pioneered scientific programming, COBOL (1959) became mainstream in business and government, and C (1972) spread with UNIX thanks to portable compilers. The clack of typewriter-style terminals replaced the grind of card punches, shifting programming from physical manipulation to linguistic expression.</p>

<h3 id="structured--object-oriented-programming-1970s-1980s">Structured &amp; Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1980s)</h3>

<p>Structured and object-oriented programming emphasized modularity, reuse, and abstraction. Compiler innovations enabled structured paradigms in Pascal (1970), while object-oriented compilers supported inheritance and polymorphism in C++ (1985). These enabling technologies made modular, reusable code possible, while developers worked with CRT monitors glowing green text and floppy disks snapping into drives</p>

<h3 id="ides--libraries-1990s">IDEs &amp; Libraries (1990s)</h3>

<p>Integrated development environments (IDEs) combined compilers, debuggers, and editors into graphical interfaces. Visual Studio was enabled by faster processors, GUI tool-kits, and extensible plug-in architectures. Java introduced the JVM in 1995, a virtual machine that allowed “write once, run anywhere.” Reusable libraries and frameworks amplified productivity by abstracting common functionality. The tactile experience shifted to mouse clicks, drag-and-drop interfaces, and the buzz of desktop towers under desks.</p>

<h3 id="web--scripting-languages-late-1990s-2000s">Web &amp; Scripting Languages (Late 1990s-2000s)</h3>

<p>Web and scripting languages thrived thanks to browser engines, dynamic interpreters, and frameworks. JavaScript became mainstream with Netscape (1995) and later engines like V8 (2008) powered dynamic web applications. Python (first released in 1991) gained widespread adoption for web development in the 2000s and later dominated data science. Eclipse IDE (2001) provided powerful development environments. Ruby’s Rails framework (2004) abstracted web complexity, enabling rapid development. Lightweight editors and laptops made coding portable, fueling the sensory experience of programming in coffee shops and classrooms</p>

<h3 id="cloud-apis-and-low-code-platforms-2010s">Cloud, APIs, and Low-Code Platforms (2010s)</h3>

<p>Cloud computing, APIs, and low-code platforms transformed programming into orchestration. Virtualization and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) enabled scalable infrastructure. REST and GraphQL APIs allowed modular integration, while low-code platforms like Mendix, OutSystems, and PowerApps used visual compilers to abstract coding. These enabling technologies shifted programming from hardware-bound tasks to swiping, clicking, and dragging in browser dashboards and they remain mainstream today.</p>

<h2 id="the-modern-mainstream-coding-experience-present">The Modern Mainstream Coding Experience (Present)</h2>

<p>The modern mainstream coding experience interprets intent by bridging human goals with machine execution through layers of abstraction. Developers no longer need to think in terms of raw hardware instructions; instead, they express intent in higher-level languages, frameworks, and APIs. Compilers, interpreters, and virtual machines translate this intent into executable code, while libraries and cloud services provide ready-made building blocks that align with common patterns. The act of coding is less about micromanaging hardware and more about shaping logic, workflows, and integrations that reflect human objectives.</p>

<h3 id="ai-assisted-coding-future">AI-Assisted Coding (Future)</h3>

<p>AI-assisted coding is enabled by large language models trained on vast amounts of code, contextual intent recognition, and integration into IDEs. Tools like GitHub Copilot, CodeWhisperer, and Tabnine embed AI directly into workflows. The enabling technology here is the LLM itself, which translates natural language into executable code. Programming has become dialogue—developers express goals in plain language, and AI generates code, tests, and documentation.</p>

<p>For example, instead of manually writing a function to validate email addresses with regex patterns, error handling, and edge cases, a developer can simply prompt: “Create a function that validates email addresses and returns helpful error messages.” The AI generates the complete implementation, including the regex pattern, input validation, and descriptive error messages. The developer then reviews, tests, and refines the output. What previously required searching documentation, writing boilerplate, and debugging syntax now happens through conversational iteration.</p>

<h2 id="programming-has-always-been-about-intent">Programming has Always Been About Intent</h2>

<p>From punch cards to Python, the core idea has stayed the same: humans express intent, machines execute it. Early programmers had to speak in binary or assembly. Then came higher-level languages like C, Java, and Python, which abstracted away the low-level details. What has changed is how coders express intent so that machines can execute it.</p>

<h3 id="natural-language-coding-is-a-paradigm-shift">Natural Language Coding Is a Paradigm Shift</h3>

<p>The real shift isn’t just accessibility, it’s responsibility. Until now, it was solely the coder’s job to translate intent (business requirements, industry policies, government regulations) into executable code. That translation required fluency in syntax, architecture, and tooling.</p>

<p>Now, intent can be expressed in natural language. AI can interpret that context to generate machine-executable instructions. This doesn’t democratize coding so much as it re-positions the boundary between domain expertise and implementation. The programmer becomes a curator of context, a validator of output, and a steward of alignment between human goals and machine behavior.</p>

<h3 id="ai-understands-what-you-meannot-just-what-you-say">AI Understands What You Mean—Not Just What You Say</h3>

<p>AI doesn’t just parse commands—it understands intent. You can say “make this faster,” “add error handling,” or “log the output,” and AI will revise the code accordingly. This conversational loop mirrors how humans collaborate, making development more fluid, iterative, and intuitive.</p>

<p>It also unlocks new modes of interaction: sketches, examples, test cases, bug reports. AI can interpret these as expressions of intent and generate code accordingly. This expands the number of ways developers can express goals and accelerates problem-solving across disciplines.</p>

<h3 id="its-just-another-toollike-ides-compilers-and-libraries">It’s Just Another Tool—Like IDEs, Compilers, and Libraries</h3>

<p>Every generation of developers has used tools to amplify their productivity. IDEs gave us auto-complete and debugging. Libraries gave us reusable components. AI gives us intelligent scaffolding, pattern recognition, and code generation. AI is not replacing developers; it’s helping them move faster and think bigger.</p>

<h3 id="verification-still-matters">Verification Still Matters</h3>

<p>Just like with compilers and frameworks, AI-generated code still needs testing, review, and validation. Developers remain responsible for architecture, correctness, security, and ethics. The shift is in how we express our goals, not in whether we need to think critically.</p>

<h3 id="the-future-is-still-intent-driven-development">The Future Is Still Intent-Driven Development</h3>

<p>In a real sense, AI assistance is just another improvement in the long line of improvements in how we write software. The goal remains the same, getting computers to do what we need them to do. Instead of writing and debugging code, we’re creating prompts and refining context to guide the AI in implementing our intent. Like with all of the improvements to date we need to learn how to effectively leverage the new technology to achieve our aims.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The narrative of AI as a revolutionary force in programming overlooks a fundamental truth: programming has always been about translating human intent into machine action. From the earliest days of flipping switches and punching cards to today’s natural language interactions with AI, the core challenge remains unchanged, bridging the gap between what we want and what machines can do. What evolves is not the essence of programming, but the sophistication of our tools for expressing intent. AI-assisted coding represents the latest chapter in this ongoing story, offering more intuitive ways to communicate with computers while preserving the essential human responsibilities of design, validation, and ethical oversight. As we embrace this new paradigm, we’re not abandoning programming, we’re refining it, making it more accessible and efficient while keeping human creativity and judgment at its center.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll cover the instructions, prompts, and chat modes I used to start to lay down the guidance for turning requirements into code. These files are critical for controlling the AI output and having a comprehensive set of instructions, prompts, and chat modes greatly increase the chances of getting AI to produce something usable.</p>

<h3 id="github-copilot-instruction-files">GitHub Copilot Instruction Files</h3>

<p>Instruction files provide detailed guidance for Copilot to follow when generating code. They define the rules, best practices, and constraints for specific tasks or domains. These files ensure consistency and quality in AI-generated outputs.</p>

<h3 id="github-copilot-prompt-files">GitHub Copilot Prompt Files</h3>

<p>Prompt files are used to define the context and objectives for Copilot in a specific session. They include the task description, expected output format, and any additional parameters to guide the AI in generating relevant and actionable content.</p>

<h3 id="github-copilot-chat-mode-files">GitHub Copilot Chat Mode Files</h3>

<p>Chat mode files configure Copilot’s behavior in a specific chat mode. They define the tools available, the model to use, and the overall purpose of the session. These files enable Copilot to act as a specialized assistant tailored to the needs of the project.</p>

<p>For more on instruction files, see <a href="https://www.codemag.com/blog/AIPractitioner/SIWT" target="_blank">Sharing Instructions with the Team</a></p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/2025-09-24/Chatmodes-Prompts-Instructions.png" alt="Chatmodes-Prompts-Instructions.png" /></p>

<p>Chat mode files configure the behavior of the AI by defining tools, models, and session-specific parameters. These chat modes use prompt files to guide the AI in generating specific outputs, such as instruction files, prompts, and generated code. Instruction files, in turn, provide detailed guidance for implementing the solution, ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices. Together, these components form a cohesive workflow that bridges high-level configuration with actionable implementation.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-core-files">Overview of Core Files</h2>

<p>In this post I’ll cover one chat mode file, one prompt file, and four instruction files that are core to the framework I created to help implement the Academia solution. These files are not domain specific and can be easily used in other projects.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ai-assisted-output.instructions.md</code> file is a comprehensive guide for ensuring the provenance, quality, and audit-ability of AI-generated artifacts. It defines the metadata requirements, workflows, and enforcement mechanisms necessary to maintain consistency and accountability in AI-assisted outputs. This file is critical for projects that rely on AI to generate code, documentation, or other artifacts, as it provides a structured approach to managing and tracking AI contributions.</p>

<p>Below is the metadata for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ai-assisted-output.instructions.md</code> file followed by the full content of the file itself. The metadata is explained in detail in the instruction file.</p>

<h1 id="ai-assisted-output-instructions">AI-Assisted Output Instructions</h1>

<p>This policy keeps AI-generated artifacts audit-able with minimal overhead. Follow it for all code, docs, diagrams, tests, or data touched by an AI assistant.</p>

<h2 id="quick-obligations">Quick Obligations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Always work inside an active chat with a unique <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chat_id</code>; block output otherwise.</li>
  <li>Capture the exact <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">provider/model@version</code> shown by the tool before generating content.</li>
  <li>Embed provenance metadata (front matter or sidecar) including the raw prompt and timestamps.</li>
  <li>Store full chat logs under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ai-logs/&lt;yyyy&gt;/&lt;mm&gt;/&lt;dd&gt;/&lt;chat-id&gt;/</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">conversation.md</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">summary.md</code>.</li>
  <li>Record task duration, keep README entries for notable new artifacts, and run the checklists below before committing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="metadata-placement">Metadata Placement</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Markdown or formats with front matter: embed YAML at the top of the file.</li>
  <li>Non-front-matter formats: create <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;artifact&gt;.meta.md</code> with the same fields.</li>
  <li>Use lowercase file paths; never create sidecars when front matter is possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="canonical-metadata-fields">Canonical Metadata Fields</h2>

<h3 id="summary-of-the-ai-assisted-outputinstructionsmd-file">Summary of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ai-assisted-output.instructions.md</code> File</h3>

<p>This instruction file outlines the obligations for working with AI-generated artifacts, including the need to capture metadata such as the model used, operator, and timestamps. It emphasizes the importance of embedding provenance metadata directly into the artifacts or using sidecar files when necessary. The file also provides detailed workflows for managing AI-assisted sessions, including logging conversations, summarizing outcomes, and ensuring proper placement of artifacts.</p>

<p>Additionally, the file includes examples of metadata for various types of AI-generated files, such as instruction files, prompt files, and chat mode files. These examples serve as templates for ensuring that all artifacts adhere to the defined standards. The enforcement section highlights the use of CI scripts to verify compliance with the metadata requirements, ensuring that all AI-generated outputs are properly documented and traceable.</p>

<p>The metadata portion captures essential information about the creation of the instruction file itself, including the model used, operator, chat ID, prompt, and timestamps. This metadata ensures that the creation of the instruction file is also auditable and traceable.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">conversation.md</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">summary.md</code> files associated with this instruction file would provide a detailed record of the interactions that led to its creation, including the specific prompts used and the decisions made during the process. The summary file is also structured to capture the objectives, deliverables, decisions, and follow-up actions related to the development of the instruction file. The summary file also allows a conversation to be interrupted and continued later.</p>

The goal is to show the development of a solution starting with the initial context and adding to the solution incrementally. Hopefully you’ll get a sense for what it’s like to build real-world solutions with the assistance of Copilot.</p>

<p>In this first installment we’ll look at the initial context provided to Copilot. This will include the initial instructions and the first prompts submitted to Copilot.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><img src="/assets/images/2025-08-30/header-AIAGSD01.png" alt="Header Image" /></p>

<p>In this series we’ll start with a conceptual model of an academic system. The academic system is a standin for any complex enterprise scale system. I’m using it because it’s a familiar domain and a publicly available model.</p>

<p>We’ll use the conceptual model to generate a domain glossary and a set of instructions for Copilot. We’ll then use those instructions to create implementation prompts and the implementation prompts will create the solution. Here is a flowchart that illustrates the process.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/2025-08-30/AIAGSD-Workflow.png" alt="AIAGSD1Workflow.png" /></p>

<p>I’ll cover each of these steps, in detail, in subsequent posts. In this post I’ll cover the initial context, the conceptual model, and the instructions prompt.</p>

<h2 id="the-academia-conceptual-model">The Academia Conceptual Model</h2>

<p>I’ll start this project with a conceptual model. The benefit of starting with a conceptual model is that it is implementation agnostic. It describes the concepts that the solution must implement, not how they should be implemented. It allows us to consider the correctness of the concepts without burdening ourselves with implementation details.</p>

<p>The image below is the conceptual model for the academic system I’m intending to build.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/2025-08-30/Academic-Model.png" alt="Academic-Model.png" /></p>

<p>This notation is Object Role Modeling (ORM). FWIW, ORM preceded Object Relational Mapping by decades. ORM is offers a compelling set of benefits, especially for conceptual data modeling and communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Conceptual Clarity &amp; Expressiveness:</strong> ORM offers several advantages over traditional modeling approaches like ER or UML. By aligning with natural language, ORM represents facts using full sentences, making models more intuitive and easier for business users to understand and validate. It also adopts an attribute-free approach, emphasizing roles and relationships rather than attributes, which enhances model stability and adaptability. Furthermore, ORM diagrams provide greater graphical richness, allowing for the clear representation of complex constraints and business rules that might be difficult to capture in ER or UML class diagrams.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Quality &amp; Governance:</strong> ORM enhances data quality and governance by enabling early detection of inconsistencies and modeling errors, which helps prevent issues before they propagate. Its structured and transparent approach also supports the enforcement of data governance policies, making it easier to maintain compliance across systems and teams.</li>
  <li><strong>Flexibility &amp; Transformation:</strong> ORM offers powerful flexibility through model transformation, allowing seamless mapping to and from formats such as ER, UML, XML, OWL, and even logic-based languages like Datalog. This interoperability makes ORM a versatile choice for diverse technical environments. Additionally, ORM excels at capturing a broader range of business rules compared to other modeling approaches, making it particularly well-suited for systems that need to evolve and adapt over time.</li>
  <li><strong>Validation &amp; Collaboration:</strong> ORM enhances collaborative validation by supporting verbalization and example population, allowing stakeholders to review and confirm models using familiar language and concrete instances. Its intuitive structure makes it accessible to both technical and non-technical participants, fostering clearer communication and stronger engagement among developers, analysts, and domain experts throughout the modeling process.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can create ORM models in Visual Studio with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ORMSolutions.NORMA2019" target="_blank">NORMA</a> (Natural Object-Role Modeling Architect) extension. NORMA ORM models provide natural feedback during model validation.</p>

<p>For our purposes, an ORM model can be verbalized as text that can be used as context for Copilot. This provides Copilot with a rich “understanding” of the problem domain that it can use to assist us in implementing a solution.</p>

<p>Here is the verbalization of the Academia model:</p>

<p>I’m not going to elaborate on the entire model as this is out scope for this post, but you see that the verbalization is understandable by people not familiar with the notation. We’ll assume that the model is correct and has been vetted by the stakeholders. If you’re interested in how the model was created, see this <a href="https://orm.net/pdf/ORMwhitePaper.pdf" target="_blank">ORM White Paper</a>.</p>

<p>By utilizing an existing model, we bypass much of the requirements gathering process. For other problem domains (like yours) you’ll want to assemble the requirements in order to provide context to the NLM. You don’t have to use ORM, but I’ve found it to be well suited to the task.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look a few of the more interesting constraints in the Academia models.</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">Teacher is audited by Teacher.
Each Teacher is audited by at most one Teacher.
It is possible that some Teacher audits more than one Teacher.
No Teacher is audited by the same Teacher.
</code></pre>

<p>The fact that no teacher is audited by the same teacher is an ir-refexive ring constraint. This constraint prevents a teacher from auditing themselves. This is an important business rule that we want to make sure the solution enforces.</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">If some Professor heads some Dept then some Academic that is that Professor works for that Dept.
</code></pre>

<p>This is a sub-type constraint that requires that department heads work for the department they head. A professor is a type of academic. Academics work for departments and professors head departments. This constraint ensures that you can’t assign a department head to an academic that doesn’t work for the department.</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">Academic is contracted until Date.
Each Academic is contracted until at most one Date.
It is possible that more than one Academic is contracted until the same Date.
For each Academic, at most one of the following holds:
   that Academic is tenured;
   that Academic is contracted until some Date.
</code></pre>

<p>The fact that an academic is either tenured or is under contract is an exclusion constraint. Under an exclusion constraint an entity can play either role but not both. When an academic becomes tenured, we’d expect that any contract date be removed.</p>

<p>In addition to these, ORM has a rich set of constraints, uniqueness, equality, inclusive or, exclusive or, frequency, and value comparison.</p>

<h2 id="workflows">Workflows</h2>

<p>While ORM is very good a expressing facts and constraints, It’s also helpful to describe the expected workflows that should be implemented. Workflows are use cases that guide data capture and processing in the application. Below are some expected workflows that should be implemented. The expectation is that in the execution of these workflows the constraints on the facts will be enforced.</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">Promote a Lecturer to Senior Lecturer
Promote a Senior Lecturer to Associate Professor
Promote an Associate Professor to Professor
Assign a Class to an Academic
Add a new Academic to the faculty capturing all required information and allowing the capture of optional
information.
Demote a Professor to Associate Professor
Demote an Associate Professor to Senior Lecturer
Demote a Senior Lecturer to Lecturer
Remove an Academic from the faculty.
Transfer an Academic between departments, validating eligibility and updating all related information
Update an Academic's personal or professional information.
Assign administrative roles (e.g., Head of Department) to eligible Academics.
</code></pre>

<p>This is the primary context of the problem domain we are going to implement. In subsequent posts I’ll add context for the expected architecture, tech stack, and standards. I’ll then proceed to systematically implement a solution guided by this context. Next up I’ll add a prompt to create instruction files and a custom chat mode in preparation for the implementation.</p>

<p>If you’re interested is seeing the files you can find them in the <a href="https://github.com/johnmillerATcodemag-com/zeus.academia" target="_blank">Academia repository</a>. If you want to follow along with your own implementation, fork this repo and use the fork to build you own implementation.</p>

This post walks you through prompting Copilot to implement a solution leveraging symlinks and junction points.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-instruction-files">What Are Instruction Files?</h2>

<p>For those of you new to using GitHub Copilot, instruction files are the blueprint for customizing how Copilot agents behave, respond, and interact with tools. Instruction files include natural language guidance that shapes the agent’s tone, reasoning style, and response formatting, making them essential for tailoring Copilot to specific workflows, domains, or compliance requirements. Instruction files give you granular control over how the agent interprets user intent and executes tasks.</p>

<p>Instruction files for GitHub Copilot agents can be located within the project repository in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.github</code> folder or a sub-folder of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.github</code>. They can also reside in the user’s home directory in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.github</code> prompts folder. The project repository location takes precedence over the user home directory location.</p>

<p>Instruction files in the project folder are in scope for that project. Instruction files in the user home directory are available to all projects. Instruction files in the user home directory are limited in that the can only reside in the prompts folder.</p>

<p>For instructions that are not project specific, such as coding standards and practices, it is desirable to share them across multiple projects. However, duplicating these files in each project repository is inefficient and error-prone. Instead, we can use symbolic links (symlinks) on Linux and macOS, and junction points on Windows, to create a single source of truth for shared instructions.</p>

<p>Ideally it would be nice to create a link in the user folder once and have it be used across all projects. Due to the limitations on the user home directory location, creating a link there would require that all of the shared instructions be in a single folder in the source and it would preclude storing any personal instructions.</p>

<p>Therefore, we need to establish these links within each project. Our solution involves creating these links seamlessly.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-symlink-and-junction-point">What Is a Symlink and Junction Point?</h2>

<p>A symlink (symbolic link) is a special type of file that points to another file or directory, allowing you to access the target as if it were located at the link’s location. Symlinks are commonly used on Linux and macOS to create shortcuts or shared folders. A junction point is a similar concept used on Windows; it creates a link to a directory, making the contents of the target directory appear in the linked location. Both mechanisms enable you to share or reuse files and folders across different locations without duplicating data, which simplifies maintenance and updates.</p>

<h2 id="the-prompt">The Prompt</h2>

<p>The solution involves creating a repo that contains the instruction files to be shared. Developers on the team can clone the repo locally and pull changes as needed. They can also change or add instructions to the repo and push those changes to the origin. Making them available to other team members.</p>

<p>Once the repo is established, we need to provide guidance for the team in creating the links to the shared instructions. We’ll ask Copilot to create scripts for each OS (Windows, Linux, macOS) that will create the appropriate link from the project repository to the shared instructions folder in the central repo. The scripts will also ensure that the linked folder is added to the project’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code> file to prevent accidental commits of the shared instructions to the project repository. In addition we’ll ask Copilot to create a README file with instructions on how to use the scripts.</p>

<p>Here is the prompt I gave GitHub Copilot:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Write three scripts to create a symlink or junction point for windows, Linux, and Mac.

Use a symlink for Linux and Mac, and a junction point for Windows using
the New-Item -ItemType Junction cmdlet.

The symlink or junction point goes to the <span class="sb">`./instructions`</span> folder in this GitHubCopilot repo
from the <span class="sb">`./github/instructions/shared`</span> folder in the Project repo.

You'll need the paths to both the GitHubCopilot repo and the Project repo in order to proceed.

Ensure that the Project repo's <span class="sb">`./github/instructions/shared`</span> folder is in the Project's <span class="sb">`.gitignore`</span> file.
Create the file if it doesn't exist. We don't want the shared instructions to be pushed into the project repo.

Create a <span class="sb">`Readme.md`</span> the describes the purpose and use of the scripts.

Put all the files in a <span class="sb">`shared-instructions`</span> folder in the GitHubCopilot repo.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This prompt instructs Copilot (or ChatGPT 5) to automate the process of sharing a set of instruction files across multiple projects by generating platform-specific scripts. The scripts are designed to create either a symbolic link (symlink) or a junction point from a project repository to a central instructions folder in the GitHubCopilot repo. For Linux and macOS, the scripts use symlinks, while on Windows, they use NTFS junctions via PowerShell’s New-Item -ItemType Junction. The prompt also requires the scripts to ensure that the shared instructions folder is listed in the project’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code> file, preventing accidental commits of shared files.</p>

<p>Copilot and ChatGPT 5 interpret this prompt as a request for practical automation tools that streamline collaboration and maintain consistency across development environments. They recognize the need for cross-platform compatibility, idempotency, and version control hygiene. The prompt’s instructions lead them to generate three scripts (one for each OS) and a README file, all organized in a shared-instructions folder. The resulting solution enables teams to easily link to and update shared instruction files, reducing duplication and simplifying maintenance.</p>

<p>Here is the README.md file generated from the prompt:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gh"># Shared Instructions Symlink/Junction Scripts</span>

These scripts create a platform-appropriate link from a Project repository to the shared <span class="sb">`instructions`</span> folder
that lives in the <span class="sb">`GitHubCopilot`</span> repo. This lets multiple projects reuse a single, centrally maintained set
of instruction files without copying them.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Link layout created:</p>

<div class="language-md highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;ProjectRepo&gt;</span>/github/instructions/shared -&gt; <span class="nt">&lt;GitHubCopilotRepo&gt;</span>/instructions

<h2 id="why-a-junction-on-windows">Why a Junction on Windows?</h2>

<p>Junctions avoid some permission / policy issues that can affect symlinks on Windows machines without Developer Mode enabled. They behave like directory symlinks for our purpose.</p>

<p>This Bash script automates the creation or refreshing of a symbolic link in a project repository, pointing to an instructions folder in a separate GitHub Copilot repository. Its main purpose is to ensure that the project always has access to shared instructions, without duplicating files.</p>

<p>The script accepts several command-line arguments: –copilot specifies the path to the GitHub Copilot repo, –project specifies the path to the project repo, –force allows overwriting an existing destination, and –relative creates a relative symlink instead of an absolute one. It validates that both source and destination paths are provided and resolves them to absolute paths for reliability.</p>

<p>Before creating the symlink, the script checks if the source directory exists. It then prepares the destination parent directory. If the destination already exists and is not a symlink, it will only remove it if the –force flag is set. If the destination is a symlink but points to the wrong target, it will be replaced. The script can compute a relative path for the symlink using a short Python snippet if requested.</p>

<p>After creating the symlink, the script ensures that the new link is ignored by Git by adding an entry to the project’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code> file. If the file does not exist, it creates one with the appropriate entry. This prevents accidental commits of the shared instructions link. The script provides clear output messages for each major step, helping users understand what actions were taken.</p>

<p>The macOS script and the Linux script are functionally identical. The logic, argument parsing, symlink creation, and .gitignore handling are the same. The scripts are kept separate for clarity and potential future customization, but currently, there are no substantive differences in their code or behavior.</p>

<p>Key Points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Both scripts use Bash and similar flags (set -euo pipefail).</li>
  <li>Argument parsing and validation are identical.</li>
  <li>Symlink creation and .gitignore updates follow the same steps.</li>
  <li>The only difference is the comment at the top indicating the target OS.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Gotcha:</em> If you need OS-specific behavior (e.g., handling macOS quirks), you can customize the macOS script independently without affecting the Linux version.</p>

<div class="language-powershell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cm">&lt;#
Creates (or refreshes) a junction in a Project repo pointing to the shared ./instructions folder
inside this GitHubCopilot repo.

Junction (target created): &lt;ProjectRepo&gt;\github\instructions\shared
Points to (source):        &lt;GitHubCopilotRepo&gt;\instructions

Parameters:
  -GitHubCopilotRepo   Path to the GitHubCopilot repo root (where the ./instructions folder lives)
  -ProjectRepo         Path to the target Project repo root (where ./github/instructions/shared will be created)
  -Force               If specified, will remove any existing file/dir/junction at the destination

Steps performed:
 1. Validate paths
 2. Ensure Project repo ./github/instructions parent folders exist
 3. Ensure destination removed if Force (or is an existing junction to wrong target)
 4. Create junction via New-Item -ItemType Junction
 5. Add github/instructions/shared/ to Project .gitignore (create file if needed)

Usage examples:
  .\create-shared-link-windows.ps1 -GitHubCopilotRepo C:\git\GitHubCopilot -ProjectRepo C:\git\MyProject
  .\create-shared-link-windows.ps1 -GitHubCopilotRepo ..\GitHubCopilot -ProjectRepo . -Force

<p>The Windows script (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create-shared-link-windows.ps1</code>) and the MacOS script (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create-shared-link-macos.sh</code>) both create a link from a project repo to a shared instructions folder, but they differ in several key ways aside from language and platform-specific commands.</p>

<h4 id="link-type">Link Type</h4>

<p>Windows: Creates a NTFS junction using PowerShell’s New-Item -ItemType Junction.
MacOS: Creates a symbolic link using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ln -s</code> in Bash.</p>

<h4 id="existing-destination-handling">Existing Destination Handling</h4>

<p>Windows: Checks if the destination is a junction or another file type, removes or throws errors accordingly, supports a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-Force</code> flag.
MacOS: Removes existing destination with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm -rf</code> if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--force</code> flag is set.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The Windows script is more complex due to NTFS junctions and PowerShell features, while the MacOS script is simpler, relying on Unix symlinks and shell commands. Both achieve the same goal but are tailored to their respective operating systems.</p>

<p>Running the scripts requires appropriate permissions, especially for creating links and modifying directories. Users should ensure they have the necessary rights to execute these scripts in their environments.</p>

<p>This solution provides a simple way of sharing instruction files across multiple projects without duplication, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance.</p>

I’ll cover the built-in chat modes and custom chat modes. We’ll dive into custom chat modes and look at some examples.</p>

<p>To be clear, when I reference Copilot, I’m referring to GitHub Copilot, not any other Microsoft Copilot-branded AI.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2025-07-30/header-GHCPCM.jpg" alt="Header Image" /></p>

<p>At first, Ask was the only Copilot chat mode. Ask mode only responds to prompts. Edit mode allowed the AI to change files. Agent mode allows Copilot to plan and execute work on it’s own. In addition to these built-in chat modes, Copilot also supports custom chat modes which allow you to focus Copilot on specific tasks. You can have as many custom chat mode files as you like in a project. I’ll discuss the cost of using custom chat modes later in the post.</p>

<h2 id="github-copilot-chat-modes">GitHub Copilot Chat Modes</h2>

<p>These four GitHub Copilot modes in VS Code each serve distinct purposes, and knowing when to use which can dramatically streamline your coding and automation tasks:</p>

<h3 id="-ask-modequick-qa-and-conceptual-guidance">🗣 Ask Mode–Quick Q&amp;A and Conceptual Guidance</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Purpose: Conversational support for understanding code, tech concepts, or brainstorming.</li>
  <li>Behavior: Responds to natural language questions using context from your current file or selection.</li>
  <li>Use cases:
    <ul>
      <li>“Explain this PowerShell function.”</li>
      <li>“What’s the best way to implement RBAC in Azure SQL?”</li>
      <li>“Give me three ways to optimize this loop.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Control: No code changes—just suggestions and explanations.</li>
  <li>Best for: Learning, debugging, and quick clarifications.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="️-edit-modetargeted-code-changes-with-review-control">✍️ Edit Mode–Targeted Code Changes with Review Control</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Purpose: Apply inline edits across selected files based on your instructions.</li>
  <li>Behavior: You choose the files and describe the change; Copilot proposes edits you can accept or reject.</li>
  <li>Use cases:
    <ul>
      <li>“Refactor this to use async/await.”</li>
      <li>“Add error handling to this script.”</li>
      <li>“Write unit tests for this class.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Control: Full review before applying changes.</li>

<p>Do what you can to align your use of Copilot with the appropriate mode.</p>

<p>Let’s take a deeper dive into custom chat modes.</p>

<h2 id="-what-is-a-custom-chat-mode">🔧 What Is a Custom Chat Mode?</h2>

<p>It’s essentially a user-defined configuration file (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chatmode.md</code>) that tells Copilot how to think, act, and respond. For example, you can create modes tailored for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>🔄 Script refactoring with PowerShell best practices</li>
  <li>🛡️ Compliance audits for RBAC in Azure SQL</li>
  <li>📚 Clean documentation with markdown linting</li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty much any repeated workflow or process is a good candidate for a custom chat mode.</p>

<p>Let’s walk through the steps for creating a custom chat mode.</p>

<h2 id="-step-by-step-creating-your-custom-chat-mode">🪜 Step-by-Step: Creating Your Custom Chat Mode</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chatmode.md</code> file.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Open a new file in your repo or workspace and name it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chatmode.md</code>.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Define the mode’s identity.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Start with a name and focus area, for example:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-txt"># Mode Name: PowerShell Admin
## Focus: Automation, CLI consistency, error handling
</code></pre>

<p>The Mode Name will show up in the Set Mode drop-down in the VS Code Copilot Chat UI.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/2025-07-30/Custome-Chat-Modes-In-Copilot-UI.png" alt="Custom Chat Modes as shown in the Copilot UI" /></p>

<h3 id="-what-the-chat-mode-focus-does">🎯 What the Chat Mode Focus Does</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Defines the mode’s core purpose—e.g., automation, refactoring, auditing.</li>
  <li>Guides Copilot’s response strategy—what to prioritize, what to avoid.</li>
  <li>Improves consistency—especially when switching between modes or sharing with teammates.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="-how-copilot-uses-focus">🧠 How Copilot Uses Focus</h4>

<p>When you load a mode with a Focus section, Copilot interprets it as a high-level directive. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">## Focus
- Automation, error handling, and CLI consistency
</code></pre>

<p>This tells Copilot to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prefer modular PowerShell scripts</li>
  <li>Emphasize robust error handling</li>
  <li>Avoid speculative or overly creative suggestions</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="-focus-best-practices">🧩 Focus Best Practices</h4>

If you missed any of the previous posts, you can find them here: <a href="https://www.codemag.com/Blog/AIPractitioner/UIAI1" target="_blank">Part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.codemag.com/Blog/AIPractitioner/UIAI2" target="_blank">Part 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.codemag.com/Blog/AIPractitioner/UIAI3" target="_blank">Part 3</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2025-05-29/header-UIAI4.jpg" alt="Header Image" /></p>

<p>Whenever data is rendered in a table, users often find it useful to sort the table by the data in one column. Modern UIs often let a user click on a column header to sort. Typically this requires changes to the HTML to trigger the sorting, code changes to sort the data, control the sort direction, and render the sorted data. Style changes are needed to provide user feedback. Sorting by more than one column complicates the implementation.</p>

<p>Rather than hand-coding the changes it could be more effective to ask GHC to attempt the implementation as it will likely be faster and hopefully with good quality. The prompt to GHC and it’s response are enclosed in horizontal lines.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the prompt I gave Claude 3.7 Sonnet with the context of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vSalesFunnelSummary.vue</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prompt: Add the ability to sort the detail-table by Status, Total Deal Value, or Average Age.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the Copilot response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GHC: # Adding Sorting Functionality to the Sales Funnel Summary Table.
I’ll add the ability to sort the details table by implementing sort functionality on the table headers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="step-by-step-solution">Step-by-Step Solution:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Add state variables to track the sort field and direction</li>
  <li>Create a computed property that returns the sorted data</li>
  <li>Implement a toggle sort function</li>
  <li>Update the table headers to be clickable and show sort indicators</li>
  <li>Use the sorted data in the table rendering</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>GHC generated a new version of the Vue with several modifications. I’ll talk through what GHC’s modification rather than the entire code listing. If you interested in the rest of the code, it’s included as <a href="#Listing1">Listing 1</a> at the end of the post.
<a id="Back2Article1"> </a></p>

<h3 id="update-the-table-headers-to-be-clickable-and-show-sort-indicators">Update the Table Headers to be Clickable and Show Sort Indicators</h3>

<p>First up are the HTML changes. GHC updated the Status, Total Deal Value, and Average Age column header cells to add the UI and triggers needed to implement the sorting.</p>

<p>The column header cell is interactive: it uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@click</code> directive to call a method named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toggleSort</code> with an argument associated with the sorted column (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dealStatus</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">totalDealValue</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">averageAge</code>) whenever the header is clicked. This suggests that clicking the header will sort the table rows based on the associated field.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class="sortable"</code> adds a CSS class to visually indicate that the column can be sorted by adding a hover effect.</p>

<p>Inside the header, there is a conditional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;span&gt;</code> element that displays a sort indicator (an up or down arrow) only if the current value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortField</code> matches the associated field. The arrow direction is determined by the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortDirection</code>: an upward arrow (▲) for ascending order and a downward arrow (▼) for descending order. This provides a clear visual cue to users about the current sort state of the column.</p>

<h3 id="use-the-sorted-data-in-the-table-rendering">Use the Sorted Data in the Table Rendering</h3>

<p>The last code change in this section is the change to render the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortedStatus</code> collection instead of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">summary.byDealStatus</code> collection.</p>

<p>Here are the HTML change to the <strong>vSalesFunnelDetail</strong> Vue.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/2025-05-29/vSalesFunnelDetail.html.png" alt="The HTML change to the vSalesFunnelDetail Vue" /></p>

<p>The style changes for sortable columns are fairly straight forward. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.sortable</code> class is applied to table headers that users can click to sort data. It changes the cursor to a pointer, signaling interactivity, and disables text selection to prevent accidental highlighting when clicking. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">position: relative;</code> property allows for absolutely positioned child elements, such as the sort indicators.</p>

<p>When a user hovers over a sortable column, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.sortable:hover</code> selector changes the background color to a light gray (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#f5f5f5</code>), providing visual feedback that the column is interactive. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.sort-indicator</code> class is used for elements (like arrows or icons) that visually indicate the current sort direction. It adds a small left margin and ensures the indicator is displayed inline with the column header text.</p>

<p>Here are the style changes to the <strong>vSalesFunnelDetail</strong> Vue.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/2025-05-29/vSalesFunnelDetail.html.png" alt="The style changes to the vSalesFunnelDetail Vue" /></p>

<h3 id="add-state-variables-to-track-the-sort-field-and-direction">Add State Variables to Track the Sort Field and Direction</h3>

<p>The first set of code changes defines two reactive variables using Vue’s Composition API and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref</code> function. The first variable, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortField</code>, is initialized with the string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'dealStatus'</code>. This means that, by default, any sorting logic in the component will use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'dealStatus'</code> property of the data as the field to sort by. The second variable, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortDirection</code>, is initialized with the string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'asc'</code>, which stands for ascending order which is the default sorting direction.</p>

<p>By using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref</code>, both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortField</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortDirection</code> become reactive references. This means that if their values change (for example, when a user clicks a column header to change the sort order), Vue will automatically update any part of the template or computed properties that depend on these values.</p>

<p>Here are the state variable code changes to the <strong>vSalesFunnelDetail</strong> Vue.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/2025-05-29/vSalesFunnelDetail.script.1.png" alt="The state variable code changes to the vSalesFunnelDetail Vue" /></p>

<h3 id="create-a-computed-property-that-returns-the-sorted-data">Create a Computed Property That Returns the Sorted Data</h3>

<p>The main code changes to implement sorting are defining a computed property called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortedStatuses</code> and a function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toggleSort</code> within a Vue component using the Composition API. The purpose of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortedStatuses</code> is to provide a dynamically sorted array of deal statuses, which is used to display a sortable table in the UI.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortedStatuses</code> computed property first checks if the summary object and its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">byDealStatus</code> property are available. If not, it returns an empty array to prevent errors. If the data exists, it creates a shallow copy of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">byDealStatus</code> array and sorts it based on the currently selected sort field and direction. The sorting logic checks if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortField</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'dealStatus'</code>; if so, it sorts by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dealStatus</code> property of each item. Otherwise, it sorts by the property specified by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortField.value</code>. The sort direction is controlled by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortDirection.value</code>, toggling between ascending (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'asc'</code>) and descending (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'desc'</code>). The comparison uses subtraction, which works for numeric fields, but could cause issues if the fields are strings (a potential “gotcha” to watch for).</p>

<h3 id="implement-a-toggle-sort-function">Implement a Toggle Sort Function</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toggleSort</code> function is used to change the sorting behavior when a user interacts with the UI (for example, by clicking a column header). If the user clicks the same field that’s already being sorted, the function toggles the sort direction. If a new field is selected, it sets that as the new sort field and defaults the direction to ascending.</p>

<p>Here are the main code changes to the <strong>vSalesFunnelDetail</strong> Vue.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/2025-05-29/vSalesFunnelDetail.script.2.png" alt="The main code changes to the vSalesFunnelDetail Vue" /></p>

<p>The final set of changes to the code are modifications to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setup()</code> function return statement. In this context, the return statement exposes specific variables, computed properties, and functions to the component’s template, making them accessible for data binding and event handling. Here Copilot added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortField</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortDirection</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortedStatuses</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toggleSort</code>.</p>

<p>By returning these properties and methods, the component ensures they are available for use in the template, supporting dynamic rendering, user interaction, and data presentation.</p>

<p>This is another good example of GHC making seamless change to a user interface with no more effort than a reasonably accurate prompt. In this case, the first prompt submitted produced something very close to the desired results. Outside of some minor cosmetic changes, the only significant issue with the implementation is that there is some repeating logic that could be eliminated by turning the sortable header into a separate component. I’ll improve the implementation by asking GHC to componentize the sortable table header.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Prompt: Extract the sortable header as a separate component. Include all of the relevant code, html, and css. Replace the existing implementation with the new component.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>GHC: Create a new component for the sortable table header. Import and use the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SortableHeader</code> component in place of the previous implementation.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Let’s review the suggested changes.</p>

<p>As requested Copilot created a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SortableHeader</code> Vue. This Vue defines a table header (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;th&gt;</code>) that is designed to be sortable. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:class</code> binding applies the class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortable</code> to the header by default, and conditionally adds the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">active</code> class if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isActive</code> property is true. This allows for visual feedback to indicate which column is currently being sorted.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@click="onClick"</code> directive attaches a click event handler, so when the header is clicked, it triggers the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onClick</code> method.</p>

<p>Inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;th&gt;</code>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;slot /&gt;</code> element allows you to insert custom content, such as the column label, from the parent component. If the column is active (i.e., currently being sorted), a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;span&gt;</code> with the class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort-indicator</code> is displayed. This span shows an upward arrow (▲) if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortDirection</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"asc"</code> (ascending), or a downward arrow (▼) if it is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"desc"</code> (descending). This visual cue helps users understand the current sort state of the column.</p>

<p>Here is the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SortableHeader</code> component HTML:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;template&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;th</span> <span class="na">:class=</span><span class="s">"['sortable', { active: isActive }]"</span> <span class="err">@</span><span class="na">click=</span><span class="s">"onClick"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;slot</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">v-if=</span><span class="s">"isActive"</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"sort-indicator"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      {{ sortDirection === "asc" ? "▲" : "▼" }}
    <span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/th&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/template&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The component accepts three required properties: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">field</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortField</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortDirection</code>, all of which are strings. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">field</code> property identifies which column this header represents. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortField</code> property indicates which column is currently being sorted, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortDirection</code> specifies the current sort order (for example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"asc"</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"desc"</code>).</p>

<p>A computed property, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isActive</code>, checks if the current header is the one being sorted by comparing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortField</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">field</code>. This is useful for visually indicating the active sort column in the UI.</p>

<p>The component emits a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toggle-sort</code> event when the header is clicked, passing its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">field</code> value as a payload. This allows the parent component to update the sorting state accordingly. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onClick</code> method handles this event emission.</p>

<p>Here is the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SortableHeader</code> component script:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>

      <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.sortable</code> class gives elements a pointer cursor to indicate interactivity, disables text selection for a smoother user experience, and sets the position to relative, which is often used to position child elements absolutely within the header. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.sortable:hover</code> selector changes the background color when the user hovers over the header, providing a visual cue that the element is interactive. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.sort-indicator</code> class adds a small left margin and ensures the indicator (such as an arrow or icon) is displayed inline with the header text. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.active</code> class makes the font bold, typically used to highlight the currently sorted column.</p>

<p>Because the styles are scoped, they only apply to this component, preventing unintended side effects elsewhere in your application.</p>

<p>Here is the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SortableHeader</code> component CSS:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;style </span><span class="na">scoped</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/style&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now for the changes to the <strong>vSalesFunnelDetail</strong> Vue. If you interested in the rest of the code, it’s included as <a href="#Listing2">Listing 2</a> at the end of the post.
<a id="Back2article2"> </a></p>

<p>In the HTML, Copilot has replaced the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;th&gt;</code> elements with references to the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SortableHeader</code> component.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">field="dealStatus"</code> property tells the component which data field it represents. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:sortField="sortField"</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:sortDirection="sortDirection"</code> properties are bound to reactive data or computed properties in your parent component, indicating the current field being sorted and the direction of the sort (ascending or descending).</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@toggle-sort="toggleSort"</code> part is an event listener. When the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SortableHeader</code> emits a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toggle-sort</code> event (when the user clicks the header), it triggers the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toggleSort</code> method in the parent component updating the sorting state.</p>

<p>Here are the changes Copilot made to the <strong>vSalesFunnelDetail</strong> HTML:</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/2025-05-29/vSalesFunnelDetail.comp.html.png" alt="The changes Copilot made to the `vSalesFunnelDetail` HTML" /></p>

<p>The import statement brings in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SortableHeader</code> component from the specified path (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"@/components/SortableHeader.vue"</code>). By importing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SortableHeader</code>, we can use it as a child component within the current Vue component (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vSalesFunnelSummary.vue</code>), promoting code reuse and modularity. Encapsulating the logic and presentation of the sortable table headers in a dedicated component isolates the code in the component from the reset of the app reducing side-effects.</p>

<p>In Vue, the components option is used to locally register other components that you want to use within the template of the current component. By listing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SortableHeader</code> inside the components object, you make it available for use as a custom element (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;SortableHeader /&gt;</code>) in the template section of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vSalesFunnelSummary.vue</code>.</p>

<p>Here are the changes Copilot made to the <strong>vSalesFunnelDetail</strong> script:</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/2025-05-29/vSalesFunnelDetail.comp.script.png" alt="The changes Copilot made to the `vSalesFunnelDetail` script" /></p>

<p>Copilot drops the CSS used by the sortable header in the <strong>vSalesFunnelDetail</strong> Vue. These styles now reside in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SortableHeader</code> component.</p>

<p>Here are the changes Copilot made to the <strong>vSalesFunnelDetail</strong> CSS:</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/2025-05-29/vSalesFunnelDetail.comp.syles.png" alt="The changes Copilot made to the `vSalesFunnelDetail` CSS" /></p>

<p>This helps keep the code modular and organized by breaking down complex UIs into smaller, reusable components. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SortableHeader</code> component can be used in any Vue needing this functionality.</p>

<p>This concludes this series on using AI to develop user interfaces. I’ll likely return to UI development in the future.</p>

While this post is largely stand-alone, consider reading parts <a href="https://www.codemag.com/blog/AIPractitioner/UIAI" target="_blank">1</a> and <a href="https://www.codemag.com/Blog/AIPractitioner/UIAI2" target="_blank">2</a> before reading this post.</p>

<p>We’ve looked at using AI to create and add UI components in prior posts. In this post I’ll add a data visualization to a page.</p>

<p>This figure shows a rendered Sales Funnel Summary page before making any changes:</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/2025-04-30/vSalesFunnelSummary-Rendered-before-Changes.png" alt="The vSalesFunnelSummary page rendered before any changes" /></p>

<p>The goal in this post is to have AI add a data visualization of the sales funnel to the page.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt: Using css, add a Sales Funnel graphic from the data in the detail-table. Include the total value and the average age. Don’t include ‘unknown’ or ‘closed lost’.</strong></p>

<p>Below is the response from the Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking model.</p>

<p><em>Begin Response</em></p>

<p><em>I’ll add a CSS-based Sales Funnel visualization between your summary table and the details table. Here’s how to implement it:</em></p>

<p>This implementation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Adds a new funnel visualization between your summary table and details table</li>
  <li>Filters the data to exclude “Unknown” (status 0) and “Closed Lost” (status 5)</li>
  <li>Sorts the stages by deal status for a logical progression</li>
  <li>Dynamic sizing - Each stage’s width is calculated based on the number of deals relative to the maximum count</li>
  <li>Includes key metrics - Each stage shows:
    <ul>
      <li>The stage name</li>
      <li>Number of deals</li>
      <li>Total deal value</li>
      <li>Average age</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Visually appealing design with:
    <ul>
      <li>Gradient backgrounds that vary by stage</li>
      <li>Hover effects for interactivity</li>
      <li>Smooth transitions</li>
      <li>Consistent spacing and alignment</li>
      <li>Box shadows for depth</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>The funnel provides a clear visual representation of your sales pipeline, showing how deals progress through different stages while highlighting the total value and average age at each stage.</em></p>

<p><em>End Response</em></p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown of the changes:</p>

<p>Add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">funnel-container</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code> that contains a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code> for each stage being rendered, which in turn, contains divs for the data elements.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/2025-04-30/vSalesFunnelSummary-Template-Changes.png" alt="Changes to the vSalesFunnelSummary Vue Template implementing the CSS data visualization" /></p>

<p>Add stage filtering and width calculation. Import <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">computed</code> in order to filter out the unknown and closed won stages and define a function that does the filtering. Also define a function to calculate the stage width based on the number of leads. Finally, return the new function so that it can be called elsewhere.</p>

<p>Because I asked for a CSS implementation, most of the work in rendering sales funnel visualization is done with CSS styles. These styles define the backgrounds of each stage and change to the headings. The linear gradient is a nice touch!</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/2025-04-30/vSalesFunnelSummary-Style-Changes-2.png" alt="Changes to the vSalesFunnelSummary Vue Styles for the CSS data visualization" /></p>

<p>The remainder of the CSS sales funnel visualization styles define the appearance of the stages and the appearance of the text in each stage. Including a nice hover effect.</p>

<p>Here is the page rendered with the CSS data visualization:</p>

<p>This is a workable implementation of the Sales Funnel visualization. It certainly could be improved by altering the styles or even have Copilot alter the styles. As is, it does the job without manual coding.</p>

<p>Now I’ll ask Copilot to remove the CSS implementation and replace it with an implementation built with chart.js.</p>

<h2 id="replace-the-css-implementation-with-a-chartjs-implementation">Replace the CSS Implementation with a chart.js Implementation</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.chartjs.org/" target="_blank">chart.js</a> is a flexible and widely-used open-source JavaScript library for creating interactive, responsive data visualizations in web applications. It provides a simple yet powerful API that enables developers to render various chart types (including bar, line, pie, radar, and many others) using HTML5 Canvas elements. chart.js offers extensive customization options for colors, animations, legends, tooltips, and scales, while maintaining excellent performance even with large datasets. The library automatically handles responsiveness across different screen sizes, supports accessibility features, and integrates seamlessly with modern JavaScript frameworks like Vue, React, and Angular.</p>

<p>Here is how I used Copilot to implement the chart.js visualization:</p>

<p><strong>Prompt: Replace the CSS chart with a similar chart using chart.js</strong></p>

<p>Below is the response from the Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking model. As it was generated:</p>

<p><em>Begin Response</em></p>

<p><em>To replace the CSS-based chart with a chart.js implementation, you’ll need to:</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Install chart.js</li>
  <li>Replace the CSS funnel visualization with a canvas element</li>
  <li>Add the chart.js initialization code</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Here’s how to implement it:</em></p>

<p>Here is a breakdown of the changes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Replace the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">funnel-container</code> div with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chart-container</code> div.</li>
</ol>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<ol>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Chart</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">registrables</code> functions are imported from the chart.js library, along with the associated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">watch</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nextTick</code> triggers.</li>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<ol>
  <li>The stage width calculation is no longer needed and is removed.</li>

<ol>
  <li>Add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">renderChart</code> function that defines the chart.js data visualization.</li>
</ol>

<p><br />

<p><br /><br /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Wire up triggers and drop <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getStageWidth</code> from return in favor of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chartCanvas</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><br />

<p><br /><br /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.funnel-container</code> style with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.chart-container</code> style.</li>
</ol>

<p><br />

<p><br /><br /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Remove the styles used by the CSS Sales Funnel visualization implementation.</li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<img src="../assets/images/2025-04-30/vSalesFunnelSummary-chartjs-Style-Changes-2.png" alt="Removing the styles used by the CSS visualization from the vSalesFunnelSummary Vue" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Here is the page rendered with the chart.js data visualization.</li>
</ol>

<p><br />
<img src="../assets/images/2025-04-30/vSalesFunnelSummary-Rendered-After-chartjs-Changes.png" alt="Rendering the vSalesFunnelSummary Vue after implementing chart.js changes" /></p>

<p>This is also a workable implementation. It’s lost the “funnel” appearance from the CSS implementation but adds the Number of Deals axis. Also the data is hidden in a tool tip:</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/2025-04-30/vSalesFunnelSummary-Rendered-After-chartjs-Changes-with-tooltip.png" alt="The vSalesFunnelSummary Vue showing the stage data in a tool tip" /></p>

<p>As you can see creating data visualizations using Copilot is surprisingly easy. Even to the point of being able to remove an existing implementation and replacing it with a new implementation. Also important is that no manual code changes were needed and both implementations worked the first time.</p>
